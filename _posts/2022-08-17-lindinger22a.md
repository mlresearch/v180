title: Laplace approximated Gaussian process state-space models
abstract: Gaussian process state-space models describe time series data in a probabilistic
  and non-parametric manner using a Gaussian process transition function. As inference
  is intractable, recent methods use variational inference and either rely on simplifying
  independence assumptions on the approximate posterior or learn the temporal states
  iteratively. The latter hampers optimization since the posterior over the presence
  can only be learned once the posterior governing the past has converged. We present
  a novel inference scheme that applies stochastic variational inference for the Gaussian
  process posterior and the Laplace approximation on the temporal states. This approach
  respects the conditional dependencies in the model and, through the Laplace approximation,
  treats the temporal states jointly, thereby avoiding their sequential learning.
  Our method is computationally efficient and  leads to better calibrated predictions
  compared to state-of-the art alternatives on synthetic data and on a range of benchmark
  datasets.
