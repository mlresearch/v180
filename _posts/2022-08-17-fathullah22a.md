title: 'Self-distribution distillation: efficient uncertainty estimation'
abstract: Deep learning is increasingly being applied in safety-critical domains.
  For these scenarios it is important to know the level of uncertainty in a modelâ€™s
  prediction to ensure appropriate decisions are made by the system. Deep ensembles
  are the de-facto standard approach to obtaining various measures of uncertainty.
  However, ensembles often significantly increase the resources required in the training
  and/or deployment phases. Approaches have been developed that typically address
  the costs in one of these phases. In this work we propose a novel training approach,
  self-distribution distillation (S2D), which is able to efficiently train a single
  model that can estimate uncertainties. Furthermore it is possible to build ensembles
  of these models and apply hierarchical ensemble distillation approaches. Experiments
  on CIFAR-100 showed that S2D models outperformed standard models and Monte-Carlo
  dropout. Additional out-of-distribution detection experiments on LSUN, Tiny ImageNet,
  SVHN showed that even a standard deep ensemble can be outperformed using S2D based
  ensembles and novel distilled models.
