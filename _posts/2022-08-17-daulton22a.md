title: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization over high-dimensional search spaces
abstract: Many real world scientific and industrial applications require optimizing
  multiple competing black-box objectives. When the objectives are expensive-to-evaluate,
  multi-objective Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular approach because of its
  high sample efficiency. However, even with recent methodological advances, most
  existing multi-objective BO methods perform poorly on search spaces with more than
  a few dozen parameters and rely on global surrogate models that scale cubically
  with the number of observations. In this work we propose MORBO, a scalable method
  for multi-objective BO over high-dimensional search spaces. MORBO identifies diverse
  globally optimal solutions by performing BO in multiple local regions of the design
  space in parallel using a coordinated strategy. We show that MORBO significantly
  advances the state-of-the-art in sample efficiency for several high-dimensional
  synthetic problems and real world applications, including an optical display design
  problem and a vehicle design problem with 146 and 222 parameters, respectively.
  On these problems, where existing BO algorithms fail to scale and perform well,
  MORBO provides practitioners with order-of-magnitude improvements in sample efficiency
  over the current approach.
