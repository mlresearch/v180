title: 'Temporal abstractions-augmented temporally contrastive learning: An alternative
  to the Laplacian in RL'
abstract: In reinforcement learning, the graph Laplacian has proved to be a valuable
  tool in the task-agnostic setting, with applications ranging from skill discovery
  to reward shaping. Recently, learning the Laplacian representation has been framed
  as the optimization of a temporally-contrastive objective to overcome its computational
  limitations in large (or continuous) state spaces. However, this approach requires
  uniform access to all states in the state space, overlooking the exploration problem
  that emerges during the representation learning process. In this work, we propose
  an alternative method that is able to recover, in a non-uniform-prior setting, the
  expressiveness and the desired properties of the Laplacian representation. We do
  so by combining the representation learning with a skill-based covering policy,
  which provides a better training distribution to extend and refine the representation.
  We also show that a simple augmentation of the representation objective with the
  learned temporal abstractions improves dynamics-awareness and helps exploration.
  We find that our method succeeds as an alternative to the Laplacian in the non-uniform
  setting and scales to challenging continuous control environments. Finally, even
  if our method is not optimized for skill discovery, the learned skills can successfully
  solve difficult continuous navigation tasks with sparse rewards, where standard
  skill discovery approaches are no so effective.
