title: 'Feature learning and random features in standard finite-width convolutional
  neural networks: An empirical study'
abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel is an important milestone in the ongoing effort
  to build a theory for deep learning. Its prediction that sufficiently wide neural
  networks behave as kernel methods, or equivalently as random feature models arising
  from linearized networks, has been confirmed empirically for certain wide architectures.
  In this paper, we compare the performance of two common finite-width convolutional
  neural networks, LeNet and AlexNet, to their linearizations on common benchmark
  datasets like MNIST and modified versions of it, CIFAR-10 and an ImageNet subset.
  We demonstrate empirically that finite-width neural networks, generally, greatly
  outperform the finite-width linearization of these architectures. When increasing
  the problem difficulty of the classification task, we observe a larger gap which
  is in line with common intuition that finite-width neural networks perform feature
  learning which finite-width linearizations cannot. At the same time, finite-width
  linearizations improve dramatically with width, approaching the behavior of the
  wider standard networks which in turn perform slightly better than their standard
  width counterparts. Therefore, it appears that feature learning for non-wide standard
  networks is important but becomes less significant with increasing width. We furthermore
  identify cases where both standard and linearized networks match in performance,
  in agreement with NTK theory, and a case where a wide linearization outperforms
  its standard width counterpart.
