title: Set-valued prediction in hierarchical classification with constrained representation
  complexity
abstract: 'Set-valued prediction is a well-known concept in multi-class classification.
  When a classifier is uncertain about the class label for a test instance, it can
  predict a set of classes instead of a single class. In this paper, we focus on hierarchical
  multi-class classification problems, where valid sets (typically) correspond to
  internal nodes of the hierarchy. We argue that this is a very strong restriction,
  and we propose a relaxation by introducing the notion of representation complexity
  for a predicted set. In combination with probabilistic classifiers, this leads to
  a challenging inference problem for which specific combinatorial optimization algorithms
  are needed. We propose three methods and evaluate them on benchmark datasets: a
  naïve approach that is based on matrix-vector multiplication, a reformulation as
  a knapsack problem with conflict graph, and a recursive tree search method. Experimental
  results demonstrate that the last method is computationally more efficient than
  the other two approaches, due to a hierarchical factorization of the conditional
  class distribution.'
