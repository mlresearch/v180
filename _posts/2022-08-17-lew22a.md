title: Recursive Monte Carlo and variational inference with auxiliary variables
abstract: 'A key design constraint when implementing Monte Carlo and variational inference
  algorithms is that it must be possible to cheaply and exactly evaluate the marginal
  densities of proposal distributions and variational families. This takes many interesting
  proposals off the table, such as those based on involved simulations or stochastic
  optimization. This paper broadens the design space, by presenting a framework for
  applying Monte Carlo and variational inference algorithms when proposal densities
  cannot be exactly evaluated. Our framework, recursive auxiliary-variable inference
  (RAVI), instead approximates the necessary densities using meta-inference: an additional
  layer of Monte Carlo or variational inference, that targets the proposal, rather
  than the model. RAVI generalizes and uniﬁes several existing methods for inference
  with expressive approximating families, which we show correspond to speciﬁc choices
  of meta-inference algorithm, and provides new theory for analyzing their bias and
  variance. We illustrate RAVI’s design framework and theorems by using them to analyze
  and improve upon Salimans et al.’s Markov Chain Variational Inference, and to design
  a novel sampler for Dirichlet process mixtures, achieving state-of-the-art results
  on a standard benchmark dataset from astronomy and on a challenging datacleaning
  task with Medicare hospital data.'
