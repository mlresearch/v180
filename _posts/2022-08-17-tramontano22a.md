title: Learning linear non-Gaussian polytree models
abstract: " In the context of graphical causal discovery, we adapt the versatile framework
  of linear non-Gaussian acyclic models (LiNGAMs) to propose new algorithms to efficiently
  learn graphs that are polytrees.  Our approach combines the Chowâ€“Liu algorithm,
  which first learns the undirected tree structure, with novel schemes to orient the
  edges.  The orientation schemes assess algebraic relations among moments of the
  data-generating distribution and are computationally inexpensive. We establish high-dimensional
  consistency results for our approach and compare different algorithmic versions
  in numerical experiments."
