title: Meta-learning without data via Wasserstein distributionally-robust model fusion
abstract: 'Existing meta-learning works assume that each task has available training
  and testing data. However, there are many available pre-trained models without accessing
  their training data in practice. We often need a single model to solve different
  tasks simultaneously as this is much more convenient to deploy the models.  Our
  work aims to meta-learn a model initialization from these pre-trained models without
  using corresponding training data. We name this challenging problem setting as Data-Free
  Learning To Learn (DFL2L). We propose a distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
  framework to learn a black-box model to fuse and compress all the pre-trained models
  into a single network to address this problem. To encourage good generalization
  to the unseen new tasks, the proposed DRO framework diversifies the learned task
  embedding associated with each pre-trained model to cover the diversity in the underlying
  training task distributions. A model initialization is sampled from the black-box
  network during meta-testing as the meta learned initialization. Extensive experiments
  on offline and online DFL2L settings and several real image datasets demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed methods. '
