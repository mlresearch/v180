title: Variational multiple shooting for Bayesian ODEs with Gaussian processes
abstract: Recent machine learning advances have proposed black-box estimation of \textit{unknown
  continuous-time system dynamics} directly from data. However, earlier works are
  based on approximative solutions or point estimates. We propose a novel Bayesian
  nonparametric model that uses Gaussian processes to infer posteriors of unknown
  ODE systems directly from data. We derive sparse variational inference with decoupled
  functional sampling to represent vector field posteriors. We also introduce a probabilistic
  shooting augmentation to enable efficient inference from arbitrarily long trajectories.
  The method demonstrates the benefit of computing vector field posteriors, with predictive
  uncertainty scores outperforming alternative methods on multiple ODE learning tasks.
