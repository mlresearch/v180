title: 'Binary independent component analysis: a non-stationarity-based approach'
abstract: We consider independent component analysis of binary data. While fundamental
  in practice, this case has been much less developed than ICA for continuous data.
  We start by assuming a linear mixing model in a continuous-valued latent space,
  followed by a binary observation model. Importantly, we assume that the sources
  are non-stationary; this is necessary since any non-Gaussianity would essentially
  be destroyed by the binarization. Interestingly, the model allows for closed-form
  likelihood by employing the cumulative distribution function of the multivariate
  Gaussian distribution. In stark contrast to the continuous-valued case, we prove
  non-identifiability of the model with few observed variables; our empirical results
  imply identifiability when the number of observed variables is higher. We present
  a practical method for binary ICA that uses only pairwise marginals, which are faster
  to compute than the full multivariate likelihood. Experiments give insight into
  the requirements for the number of observed variables, segments, and latent sources
  that allow the model to be estimated.
