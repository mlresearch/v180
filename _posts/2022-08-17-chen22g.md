title: 'Offline reinforcement learning under value and density-ratio realizability:
  The power of gaps'
abstract: 'We consider a challenging theoretical problem in offline reinforcement
  learning (RL): obtaining sample-efficiency guarantees with a dataset lacking sufficient
  coverage, under only realizability-type assumptions for the function approximators.
  While the existing theory has addressed learning under realizability and under non-exploratory
  data separately, no work has been able to address both simultaneously (except for
  a concurrent work which we compare in detail). Under an additional gap assumption,
  we provide guarantees to a simple pessimistic algorithm based on a version space
  formed by marginalized importance sampling (MIS), and the guarantee only requires
  the data to cover the optimal policy and the function classes to realize the optimal
  value and density-ratio functions. While similar gap assumptions have been used
  in other areas of RL theory, our work is the first to identify the utility and the
  novel mechanism of gap assumptions in offline RL with weak function approximation.'
