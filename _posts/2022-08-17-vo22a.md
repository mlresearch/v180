title: Bayesian federated estimation of causal effects from observational data
abstract: We propose a Bayesian framework for estimating causal effects from federated
  observational data sources. Bayesian causal inference is an important approach to
  learning the distribution of the causal estimands and understanding the uncertainty
  of causal effects. Our framework estimates the posterior distributions of the causal
  effects to compute the higher-order statistics that capture the uncertainty. We
  integrate local causal effects from different data sources without centralizing
  them. We then estimate the treatment effects from observational data using a non-parametric
  reformulation of the classical potential outcomes framework. We model the potential
  outcomes as a random function distributed by Gaussian processes, with defining parameters
  that can be efficiently learned from multiple data sources. Our method avoids exchanging
  raw data among the sources, thus contributing towards privacy-preserving causal
  learning. The promise of our approach is demonstrated through a set of simulated
  and real-world examples.
