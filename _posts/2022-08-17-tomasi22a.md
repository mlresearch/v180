title: Efficient inference for dynamic topic modeling with large vocabularies
abstract: Dynamic topic modeling is a well established tool for capturing the temporal
  dynamics of the topics of a corpus. In this work, we develop a scalable dynamic
  topic model by utilizing the correlation among the words in the vocabulary. By correlating
  previously independent temporal processes for words, our new model allows us to
  reliably estimate the topic representations containing less frequent words. We develop
  an amortised variational inference method with self-normalised importance sampling
  approximation to the word distribution that dramatically reduces the computational
  complexity and the number of variational parameters in order to handle large vocabularies.
  With extensive experiments on text datasets, we show that our method significantly
  outperforms the previous works by modeling word correlations, and it is able to
  handle real world data with a large vocabulary which could not be processed by previous
  continuous dynamic topic models.
