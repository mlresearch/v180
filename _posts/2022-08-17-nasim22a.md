title: Efficient learning of sparse and decomposable PDEs using random projection
abstract: Learning physics models in the form of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
  is carried out through back-propagation to match the simulations of the physics
  model with experimental observations. Nevertheless, such matching involves computation
  over billions of elements, presenting a significant computational overhead. We notice
  many PDEs in real world problems are sparse and decomposable, where the temporal
  updates and the spatial features are sparsely concentrated on small interface regions.
  We propose RAPID-PDE, an algorithm to expedite the learning of sparse and decomposable
  PDEs. Our RAPID-PDE first uses random projection to compress the high dimensional
  sparse updates and features into low dimensional representations and then use these
  compressed signals during learning. Crucially, such a conversion is only carried
  out once prior to learning and the entire learning process is conducted in the compressed
  space. Theoretically, we derive a constant factor approximation between the projected
  loss function and the original one with logarithmic number of projected dimensions.
  Empirically, we demonstrate RAPID-PDE with data compressed to 0.05% of its original
  size learns similar models compared with uncompressed algorithms in learning a set
  of phase-field models which govern the spatial-temporal dynamics of nano-scale structures
  in metallic materials.
