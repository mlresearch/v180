title: Partial likelihood Thompson sampling
abstract: We consider the problem of deciding how best to target and prioritize existing
  vaccines that may offer protection against new variants of an infectious disease.
  Sequential experiments are a promising approach; however, challenges due to delayed
  feedback and the overall ebb and flow of disease prevalence make available methods
  inapplicable for this task. We present a method, partial likelihood Thompson sampling,
  that can handle these challenges. Our method involves running Thompson sampling
  with belief updates determined by partial likelihood each time we observe an event.
  To test our approach, we ran a semi-synthetic experiment based on 200 days of COVID-19
  infection data in the US.
