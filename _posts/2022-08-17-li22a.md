title: Solving structured hierarchical games using differential backward induction
abstract: From large-scale organizations to decentralized political systems, hierarchical
  strategic decision making is commonplace. We introduce a novel class of structured
  hierarchical games (SHGs) that formally capture such hierarchical strategic interactions.
  In an SHG, each player is a node in a tree, and strategic choices of players are
  sequenced from root to leaves, with root moving first, followed by its children,
  then followed by their children, and so on until the leaves. A playerâ€™s utility
  in an SHG depends on its own decision, and on the choices of its parent and all
  the tree leaves. SHGs thus generalize simultaneous-move games, as well as Stackelberg
  games with many followers.  We leverage the structure of both the sequence of player
  moves as well as payoff dependence to develop a gradient-based back propagation-style
  algorithm, which we call Differential Backward Induction (DBI), for approximating
  equilibria of SHGs. We provide a sufficient condition for convergence of DBI and  demonstrate
  its efficacy in finding approximate equilibrium solutions to several SHG models
  of hierarchical policy-making problems.
