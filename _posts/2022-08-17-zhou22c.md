title: 'Information design for multiple independent and self-interested defenders:
  Work less, pay off more'
abstract: This paper studies the problem of information design in a general security
  game setting in which multiple independent self-interested defenders attempt to
  provide protection simultaneously on the same set of important targets against an
  unknown attacker. A principal, who can be one of the defenders, has access to certain
  private information (i.e., attacker type) whereas other defenders do not. We investigate
  the  question of how that principal, with additional private information, can influence
  the decisions of the defenders by partially and strategically revealing her information.
  We focus on the algorithmic study of information design for private signaling in
  this game setting. In particular, we develop a polynomial-time ellipsoid algorithm
  to compute an optimal private signaling scheme. Our key finding is that the separation
  oracle in the ellipsoid approach can be carefully reduced to bipartite matching.
  Furthermore, we introduce a compact representation of any ex-ante persuasive signaling
  schemes by exploiting intrinsic security resource allocation structures, enabling
  us to compute an optimal scheme significantly faster. Our experiment results show
  that by strategically revealing private information, the principal can significantly
  enhance the protection effectiveness on the targets.
