title: Federated online clustering of bandits
abstract: Contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) is an important sequential decision-making
  problem in recommendation systems. A line of works, called the clustering of bandits
  (CLUB), utilize the collaborative effect over users and dramatically improve the
  recommendation quality. Owing to the increasing application scale and public concerns
  about privacy, there is a growing demand to keep user data decentralized and push
  bandit learning to the local server side. Existing CLUB algorithms, however, are
  designed under the centralized setting where data are available at a central server.
  We focus on studying the federated online clustering of bandit (FCLUB) problem,
  which aims to minimize the total regret while satisfying privacy and communication
  considerations. We design a new phase-based scheme for cluster detection and a novel
  asynchronous communication protocol for cooperative bandit learning for this problem.
  To protect usersâ€™ privacy, previous differential privacy (DP) definitions are not
  very suitable, and we propose a new DP notion that acts on the user cluster level.
  We provide rigorous proofs to show that our algorithm simultaneously achieves (clustered)
  DP, sublinear communication complexity and sublinear regret. Finally, experimental
  evaluations show our superior performance compared with benchmark algorithms.
