title: Variational- and metric-based deep latent space for out-of-distribution detection
abstract: 'One popular deep-learning approach for the task of Out-Of-Distribution
  (OOD) detection is based on thresholding the values of per-class Gaussian likelihood
  of deep features. However, two issues arise with that approach: first, the distributions
  are often far from being Gaussian; second, many OOD data points  fall within the
  effective support of the known classes’ Gaussians. Thus, either way it is hard to
  find a good threshold. In contrast, our proposed solution for OOD detection is based
  on a new latent space where: 1) each known class is well captured by a nearly-isotropic
  Gaussian; 2) those Gaussians are far from each other and from the origin of the
  space (together, these properties effectively leave the area around the origin free
  for OOD data). Concretely, given a (possibly-trained) backbone deep net of choice,
  we use it to train a conditional variational model via a Kullback Leibler loss,
  a triplet loss, and a new distancing loss that pushes classes away from each other.  During
  inference, the class-dependent log-likelihood values of a deep feature ensemble
  of the test point are also weighted based on reconstruction errors, improving further
  the decision rule. Experiments on popular benchmarks show that our method yields
  state-of-the-art results, a feat achieved despite the fact that, unlike some competitors,
  we make no use of OOD data for training or hyperparameter tuning. Our code is available
  at \url{https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/vmdls}.'
