title: 'Equilibrium aggregation: encoding sets via optimization'
abstract: 'Processing sets or other unordered, potentially variable-sized inputs in
  neural networks is usually handled by aggregating a number of input tensors into
  a single representation. While a number of aggregation methods already exist from
  simple sum pooling to multi-head attention, they are limited in their representational
  power both from theoretical and empirical perspectives. On the search of a principally
  more powerful aggregation strategy, we propose an optimization-based method called
  Equilibrium Aggregation. We show that many existing aggregation methods can be recovered
  as special cases of Equilibrium Aggregation and that it is provably more efficient
  in some important cases. Equilibrium Aggregation can be used as a drop-in replacement
  in many existing architectures and applications. We validate its efficiency on three
  different tasks: median estimation, class counting, and molecular property prediction.
  In all experiments, Equilibrium Aggregation achieves higher performance than the
  other aggregation techniques we test.'
