title: Attribution of predictive uncertainties in classification models
abstract: Predictive uncertainties in classification tasks are often a consequence
  of model inadequacy or insufficient training data. In popular applications, such
  as image processing, we are often required to scrutinise these uncertainties by
  meaningfully attributing them to input features. This helps to improve interpretability
  assessments. However, there exist few effective frameworks for this purpose. Vanilla
  forms of popular methods for the provision of saliency masks, such as SHAP or integrated
  gradients, adapt poorly to target measures of uncertainty. Thus, state-of-the-art
  tools instead proceed by creating counterfactual or adversarial feature vectors,
  and assign attributions by direct comparison to original images. In this paper,
  we present a novel framework that combines path integrals, counterfactual explanations
  and generative models, in order to procure attributions that contain few observable
  artefacts or noise. We evidence that this outperforms existing alternatives through
  quantitative evaluations with popular benchmarking methods and data sets of varying
  complexity.
