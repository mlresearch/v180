title: Differentially private multi-party data release for linear regression
abstract: Differentially Private (DP) data release is a promising technique to disseminate
  data without compromising the privacy of data subjects. However the majority of
  prior work has focused on scenarios where a single party owns all the data. In this
  paper we focus on the multi-party setting, where different stakeholders own disjoint
  sets of attributes belonging to the same group of data subjects. Within the context
  of linear regression that allow all parties to train models on the complete data
  without the ability to infer private attributes or identities of individuals, we
  start with directly applying Gaussian mechanism and show it has the small eigenvalue
  problem. We further propose our novel method and prove it asymptotically converges
  to the optimal (non-private) solutions with increasing dataset size. We substantiate
  the theoretical results through experiments on both artificial and real-world datasets.
