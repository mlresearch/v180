title: 'Learning in Markov games: Can we exploit a general-sum opponent?'
abstract: In this paper, we study the learning problem in two-player general-sum Markov
  Games. We consider the online setting where we control a single player, playing
  against an arbitrary opponent to minimize the regret. Previous works only consider
  the zero-sum Markov Games setting, in which the two agents are completely adversarial.
  However, in some cases, the two agents may have different reward functions without
  having conflicting objectives. This involves a stronger notion of regret than the
  one used in previous works. This class of games, called general-sum Markov Games
  is far to be well understood and studied. We show that the new regret minimization
  problem is significantly harder than in standard Markov Decision Processes and zero-sum
  Markov Games. To do this, we derive a lower bound on the expected regret of any
  “good” learning strategy which shows the constant dependencies with the number of
  deterministic policies, which is not present in zerosum Markov Games and Markov
  Decision Processes. Then we propose a novel optimistic algorithm that nearly matches
  the proposed lower bound. Proving these results requires overcoming several new
  challenges that are not present in Markov Decision Processes or zero-sum Markov
  Games.
