title: A robustness test for estimating total effects with covariate adjustment
abstract: Suppose we want to estimate a total effect with covariate adjustment in
  a linear structural equation model. We have a causal graph to decide what covariates
  to adjust for, but are uncertain about the graph. Here, we propose a testing procedure,
  that exploits the fact that there are multiple valid adjustment sets for the target
  total effect in the causal graph, to perform a robustness check on the graph. If
  the test rejects, it is a strong indication that we should not rely on the graph.
  We discuss what mistakes in the graph our testing procedure can detect and which
  ones it cannot and develop two strategies on how to select a list of valid adjustment
  sets for the procedure. We also connect our result to the related econometrics literature
  on coefficient stability tests.
