title: On-the-fly adaptation of patrolling strategies in changing environments
abstract: " We consider the problem of efficient patrolling strategy adaptation in
  a changing environment where the topology of Defender’s moves and the importance
  of guarded targets change unpredictably. The Defender must instantly switch to a
  new strategy optimized for the new environment, not disrupting the ongoing patrolling
  task, and the new strategy must be computed promptly under all circumstances. Since
  strategy switching may cause unintended security risks compromising the achieved
  protection, our solution includes mechanisms for detecting and mitigating this problem.
  The efficiency of our framework is evaluated experimentally."
