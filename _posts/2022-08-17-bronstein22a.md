title: On the inductive bias of neural networks for learning read-once DNFs
abstract: Learning functions over Boolean variables is a fundamental problem in machine
  learning. But not much is known about learning such functions using neural networks.
  Here we focus on learning read-once disjunctive normal forms (DNFs) under the uniform
  distribution with a convex neural network and gradient methods. We first observe
  empirically that gradient methods converge to compact solutions with neurons that
  are aligned with the terms of the DNF. This is despite the fact that there are many
  zero training error networks that do not have this property. Thus, the learning
  process has a clear inductive bias towards such logical formulas. Following recent
  results which connect the inductive bias of gradient flow (GF) to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
  (KKT) points of minimum norm problems, we study these KKT points in our setting.
  We prove that zero training error solutions that memorize training points are not
  KKT points and therefore GF cannot converge to them. On the other hand, we prove
  that globally optimal KKT points correspond exactly to networks that are aligned
  with the DNF terms. These results suggest a strong connection between the inductive
  bias of GF and solutions that align with the DNF. We conclude with extensive experiments
  which verify our findings.
