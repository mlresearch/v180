title: Toward learning human-aligned cross-domain robust models by countering misaligned
  features
abstract: Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable prediction accuracy over i.i.d
  data, but the accuracy often drops when tested with data from another distribution.
  In this paper, we aim to offer another view of this problem in a perspective assuming
  the reason behind this accuracy drop is the reliance of models on the features that
  are not aligned well with how a data annotator considers similar across these two
  datasets. We refer to these features as misaligned features. We extend the conventional
  generalization error bound to a new one for this setup with the knowledge of how
  the misaligned features are associated with the label. Our analysis offers a set
  of techniques for this problem, and these techniques are naturally linked to many
  previous methods in robust machine learning literature. We also compared the empirical
  strength of these methods demonstrated the performance when these previous techniques
  are combined, with implementation available.
