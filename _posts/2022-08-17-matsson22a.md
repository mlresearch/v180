title: Case-based off-policy evaluation using prototype learning
abstract: Importance sampling (IS) is often used to perform off-policy evaluation
  but it is prone to several issuesâ€”especially when the behavior policy is unknown
  and must be estimated from data. Significant differences between target and behavior
  policies can result in uncertain value estimates due to, for example, high variance.
  Standard practices such as inspecting IS weights may be insufficient to diagnose
  such problems and determine for which type of inputs the policies differ in suggested
  actions and resulting values. To address this, we propose estimating the behavior
  policy for IS using prototype learning. The learned prototypes provide a condensed
  summary of the input-action space, which allows for describing differences between
  policies and assessing the support for evaluating a certain target policy. In addition,
  we can describe a value estimate in terms of prototypes to understand which parts
  of the target policy have the most impact on the estimate. We find that this provides
  new insights in the examination of a learned policy for sepsis management. Moreover,
  we study the bias resulting from restricting models to use prototypes, how bias
  propagates to IS weights and estimated values and how this varies with history length.
