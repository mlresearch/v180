title: A label efficient two-sample test
abstract: 'Two-sample tests evaluate whether two samples are realizations of the same
  distribution (the null hypothesis) or two different distributions (the alternative
  hypothesis). We consider a new setting for this problem where sample features are
  easily measured whereas sample labels are unknown and costly to obtain. Accordingly,
  we devise a three-stage framework in service of performing an effective two-sample
  test with only a small number of sample label queries: first, a classifier is trained
  with samples uniformly labeled to model the posterior probabilities of the labels;
  second, a novel query scheme dubbed bimodal query is used to query labels of samples
  from both classes, and last, the classical Friedman-Rafsky (FR) two-sample test
  is performed on the queried samples. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments
  performed on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed test controls the Type
  I error and has decreased Type II error relative to uniform querying and certainty-based
  querying. Source code for our algorithms and experimental results is available at
