title: Systematized event-aware learning for multi-object tracking
abstract: We propose an end-to-end online multi-object tracking (MOT) framework with
  a systematized event-aware loss, which is designed to control possible occurrences
  in an online MOT situation and compel the tracker to take appropriate actions when
  such events occur. Training samples from real candidates using a simulation tracker
  are generated, and a systematized event-aware association matrix is constructed
  for every frame to enable the tracker to learn the ideal action in a running environment.
  Several experiments, including ablation studies on various public MOT benchmark
  datasets, are conducted. The experimental results verify that each event affecting
  the tracking measure can be controlled, and the proposed method presents optimal
  results compared with recent state-of-the-art MOT methods.
