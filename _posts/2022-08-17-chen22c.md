title: Knowledge representation combining quaternion path integration and depth-wise
  atrous circular convolution
abstract: 'Knowledge models endeavor to improve representation and feature extraction
  capabilities while keeping low computational cost. Firstly, existing embedding models
  in hypercomplex spaces of non-Abelian group are optimized. Then a method for fast
  quaternion multiplication is proposed with proof, with which path semantics are
  computed and further integrated with the attention mechanism based on the idea semantic
  extraction of relation sequences could be regarded as a multiple rotational blending
  problem. A depth-wise atrous circular convolution framework is set up for better
  feature extraction. Experiments including Link Prediction and Path Query are conducted
  on benchmark datasets verifying our model holds advantages over state-of-the-art
  models like Rotate3D. Moreover, the model is tested on a biomedical dataset simulating
  real-world applications. An ablation study is also performed to explore the effectiveness
  of different components. '
