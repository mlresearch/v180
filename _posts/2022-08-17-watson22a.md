title: Causal discovery under a confounder blanket
abstract: Inferring causal relationships from observational data is rarely straightforward,
  but the problem is especially difficult in high dimensions. For these applications,
  causal discovery algorithms typically require parametric restrictions or extreme
  sparsity constraints. We relax these assumptions and focus on an important but more
  specialized problem, namely recovering the causal order among a subgraph of variables
  known to descend from some (possibly large) set of confounding covariates, i.e.
  a $\textit{confounder blanket}$. This is useful in many settings, for example when
  studying a dynamic biomolecular subsystem with genetic data providing background
  information. Under a structural assumption called the $\textit{confounder blanket
  principle}$, which we argue is essential for tractable causal discovery in high
  dimensions, our method accommodates graphs of low or high sparsity while maintaining
  polynomial time complexity. We present a structure learning algorithm that is provably
  sound and complete with respect to a so-called $\textit{lazy oracle}$. We design
  inference procedures with finite sample error control for linear and nonlinear systems,
  and demonstrate our approach on a range of simulated and real-world datasets. An
  accompanying $\texttt{R}$ package, $\texttt{cbl}$, is available from $\texttt{CRAN}$.
