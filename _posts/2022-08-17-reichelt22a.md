title: 'Expectation programming: Adapting probabilistic programming systems to estimate
  expectations efficiently'
abstract: We show that the standard computational pipeline of probabilistic programming
  systems (PPSs) can be inefficient for estimating expectations and introduce the
  concept of expectation programming to address this. In expectation programming,
  the aim of the backend inference engine is to directly estimate expected return
  values of programs, as opposed to approximating their conditional distributions.
  This distinction, while subtle, allows us to achieve substantial performance improvements
  over the standard PPS computational pipeline by tailoring computation to the expectation
  we care about. We realize a particular instance of our expectation programming concept,
  Expectation Programming in Turing (EPT), by extending the PPS Turing to allow so-called
  target-aware inference to be run automatically. We then verify the statistical soundness
  of EPT theoretically, and show that it provides substantial empirical gains in practice.
