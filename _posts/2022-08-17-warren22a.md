title: Generalized Bayesian quadrature with spectral kernels
abstract: Bayesian probabilistic integration, or Bayesian quadrature (BQ), has arisen
  as a popular means of numerical integral estimation with quantified uncertainty
  for problems where computational cost limits data availability. BQ leverages flexible
  Gaussian processes (GPs) to model an integrand which can be subsequently analytically
  integrated through properties of Gaussian distributions. However, BQ is inherently
  limited by the fact that the method relies on the use of a strict set of kernels
  for use in the GP model of the integrand, reducing the flexibility of the method
  in modeling varied integrand types. In this paper, we present spectral Bayesian
  quadrature, a form of Bayesian quadrature that allows for the use of any shift-invariant
  kernel in the integrand GP model while still maintaining the analytical tractability
  of the integral posterior, increasing the flexibility of BQ methods to address varied
  problem settings. Additionally our method enables integration with respect to a
  uniform expectation, effectively computing definite integrals of challenging integrands.
  We derive the theory and error bounds for this model, as well as demonstrate GBQâ€™s
  improved accuracy, flexibility, and data efficiency, compared to traditional BQ
  and other numerical integration methods, on a variety of quadrature problems.
