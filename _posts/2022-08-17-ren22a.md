title: 'A free lunch from the noise: Provable and practical exploration for representation
  learning'
abstract: Representation learning lies at the heart of the empirical success of deep
  learning for dealing with the curse of dimensionality. However, the power of representation
  learning has not been fully exploited yet in reinforcement learning (RL), due to
  i), the trade-off between expressiveness and tractability; and ii), the coupling
  between exploration and representation learning. In this paper, we first reveal
  the fact that under some noise assumption in the stochastic control model, we can
  obtain the linear spectral feature of its corresponding Markov transition operator
  in closed-form for free. Based on this observation, we propose Spectral Dynamics
  Embedding (SPEDE), which breaks the tradeoff and completes optimistic exploration
  for representation learning by exploiting the structure of the noise. We provide
  rigorous theoretical analysis of SPEDE, and demonstrate the practical superior performance
  over the existing state-of-the-art empirical algorithms on several benchmarks.
