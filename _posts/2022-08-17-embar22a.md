title: Learning explainable templated graphical models
abstract: 'Templated graphical models (TGMs) encode model structure using rules that
  capture recurring relationships between multiple random variables. While the rules
  in TGMs are interpretable, it is not clear how they can be used to generate explanations
  for the individual predictions of the model. Further, learning these rules from
  data comes with high computational costs: it typically requires an expensive combinatorial
  search over the space of rules and repeated optimization over rule weights. In this
  work, we propose a new structure learning algorithm, Explainable Structured Model
  Search (ESMS), that learns a templated graphical model and an explanation framework
  for its predictions. ESMS uses a novel search procedure to efficiently search the
  space of models and discover models that trade-off predictive accuracy and explainability.
  We introduce the notion of relational stability and prove that our proposed explanation
  framework is stable. Further, our proposed piecewise pseudolikelihood (PPLL) objective
  does not require re-optimizing the rule weights across models during each iteration
  of the search. In our empirical evaluation on three realworld datasets, we show
  that our proposed approach not only discovers models that are explainable, but also
  significantly outperforms existing state-out-the-art structure learning approaches.'
