title: Regret guarantees for model-based reinforcement learning with long-term average
  constraints
abstract: We consider the problem of constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) where
  an agent interacts with an ergodic Markov Decision Process. At every interaction,
  the agent obtains a reward and incurs $K$ costs. The agent aims to maximize the
  long-term average reward while simultaneously keeping the $K$ long-term average
  costs lower than a certain threshold. In this paper, we propose \NAM, a posterior
  sampling based algorithm using which the agent can learn optimal policies to interact
  with the CMDP. We show that with the assumption of slackness, characterized by $\kappa$,
  the optimization problem is feasible for the sampled MDPs. Further, for MDP with
  $S$ states, $A$ actions, and mixing time $T_M$, we prove that following \NAM{} algorithm,
  the agent can bound the regret of not accumulating rewards from an optimal policy
  by $\Tilde{O}(T_MS\sqrt{AT})$. Further, we show that the violations for any of the
  $K$ constraints is also bounded by $\Tilde{O}(T_MS\sqrt{AT})$. To the best of our
  knowledge, this is the first work that obtains a $\Tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bounds
  for ergodic MDPs with long-term average constraints using a posterior sampling method.
