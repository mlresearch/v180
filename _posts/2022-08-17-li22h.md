title: 'AdaCat: Adaptive categorical discretization for autoregressive models'
abstract: Autoregressive generative models can estimate complex continuous data distributions,
  like trajectory rollouts in an RL environment, image intensities, and audio. Most
  state-of-the-art models discretize continuous data into several bins and use categorical
  distributions over the bins to approximate the continuous data distribution. The
  advantage is that the categorical distribution can easily express multiple modes
  and are straightforward to optimize. However, such approximation cannot express
  sharp changes in density without using significantly more bins, which makes it parameter
  inefficient. We propose an efficient, expressive, multimodal parameterization called
  Adaptive Categorical Discretization (AdaCat). AdaCat discretizes each dimension
  of an autoregressive model adaptively, which allows the model to allocate density
  to fine intervals of interest, improving parameter efficiency. AdaCat generalizes
  both categoricals and quantile-based regression. AdaCat is a simple add-on to any
  discretization-based distribution estimator. In experiments, AdaCat improves density
  estimation for real-world tabular data, images, audio, and trajectories, and improves
  planning in model-based offline RL.
