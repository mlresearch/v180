title: Understanding and mitigating the limitations of prioritized experience replay
abstract: 'Prioritized Experience Replay (ER) has been empirically shown to improve
  sample efficiency across many domains and attracted great attention; however, there
  is little theoretical understanding of why such prioritized sampling helps and its
  limitations. In this work, we take a deep look at the prioritized ER. In a supervised
  learning setting, we show the equivalence between the error-based prioritized sampling
  method for minimizing mean squared error and the uniform sampling for cubic power
  loss. We then provide theoretical insight into why error-based prioritized sampling
  improves convergence rate upon uniform sampling when minimizing mean squared error
  during early learning. Based on the insight, we further point out two limitations
  of the prioritized ER method: 1) outdated priorities and 2) insufficient coverage
  of the sample space. To mitigate the limitations, we propose our model-based stochastic
  gradient Langevin dynamics sampling method. We show that our method does provide
  states distributed close to an ideal prioritized sampling distribution estimated
  by the brute-force method, which does not suffer from the two limitations. We conduct
  experiments on both discrete and continuous control problems to show our approachâ€™s
  efficacy and examine the practical implication of our method in an autonomous driving
  application. '
