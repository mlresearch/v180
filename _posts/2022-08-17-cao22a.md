title: Active approximately metric-fair learning
abstract: 'Existing studies on individual fairness focus on the passive setting and
  typically require $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})$ labeled instances to achieve an $\varepsilon$
  bias budget. In this paper, we build on the elegant Approximately Metric-Fair (AMF)
  learning framework and propose an active AMF learner that can provably achieve the
  same budget with only $O(\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ labeled instances. To our
  knowledge, this is a first and substantial improvement of the existing sample complexity
  for achieving individual fairness. Through experiments on three data sets, we show
  the proposed active AMF learner improves fairness on linear and non-linear models
  more efficiently than its passive counterpart as well as state-of-the-art active
  learners, while maintaining a comparable accuracy. To facilitate algorithm design
  and analysis, we also design a provably equivalent form of the approximate metric
  fairness based on uniform continuity instead of the existing almost Lipschitz continuity. '
