title: Combating the instability of mutual information-based losses via regularization
abstract: 'Notable progress has been made in numerous fields of machine learning based
  on neural network-driven mutual information (MI) bounds. However, utilizing the
  conventional MI-based losses is often challenging due to their practical and mathematical
  limitations. In this work, we first identify the symptoms behind their instability:
  (1) the neural network not converging even after the loss seemed to converge, and
  (2) saturating neural network outputs causing the loss to diverge. We mitigate both
  issues by adding a novel regularization term to the existing losses. We theoretically
  and experimentally demonstrate that added regularization stabilizes training. Finally,
  we present a novel benchmark that evaluates MI-based losses on both the MI estimation
  power and its capability on the downstream tasks, closely following the pre-existing
  supervised and contrastive learning settings. We evaluate six different MI-based
  losses and their regularized counterparts on multiple benchmarks to show that our
  approach is simple yet effective.'
