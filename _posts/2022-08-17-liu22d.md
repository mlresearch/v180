title: Offline policy optimization with eligible actions
abstract: Offline policy optimization could have a large impact on many real-world
  decision-making problems, as online learning may be infeasible in many applications.
  Importance sampling and its variants are a common used type of estimator in offline
  policy evaluation, and such estimators typically do not require assumptions on the
  properties and representational capabilities of value function or decision process
  model function classes. In this paper, we identify an important overfitting phenomenon
  in optimizing the importance weighted return, in which it may be possible for the
  learned policy to essentially avoid making aligned decisions for part of the initial
  state space. We propose an algorithm to avoid this overfitting through a new per-state-neighborhood
  normalization constraint, and provide a theoretical justification of the proposed
  algorithm. We also show the limitations of previous attempts to this approach. We
  test our algorithm in a healthcare-inspired simulator, a logged dataset collected
  from real hospitals and continuous control tasks. These experiments show the proposed
  method yields less overfitting and better test performance compared to state-of-the-art
  batch reinforcement learning algorithms.
