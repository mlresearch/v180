title: Residual bootstrap exploration for stochastic linear bandit
abstract: 'We propose a new bootstrap-based online algorithm for stochastic linear
  bandit problems. The key idea is to adopt residual bootstrap exploration, in which
  the agent estimates the next step reward by re-sampling the residuals of mean reward
  estimate. Our algorithm, residual bootstrap exploration for stochastic linear bandit
  (\texttt{LinReBoot}), estimates the linear reward from its re-sampling distribution
  and pulls the arm with the highest reward estimate. In particular, we contribute
  a theoretical framework to demystify residual bootstrap-based exploration mechanisms
  in stochastic linear bandit problems. The key insight is that the strength of bootstrap
  exploration is based on collaborated optimism between the online-learned model and
  the re-sampling distribution of residuals. Such observation enables us to show that
  the proposed \texttt{LinReBoot} secure a high-probability $\tilde{O}(d \sqrt{n})$
  sub-linear regret under mild conditions. Our experiments support the easy generalizability
  of the \texttt{ReBoot} principle in the various formulations of linear bandit problems
  and show the significant computational efficiency of \texttt{LinReBoot}. '
