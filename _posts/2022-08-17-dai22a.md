title: On provably robust meta-Bayesian optimization
abstract: 'Bayesian optimization (BO) has become popular for sequential optimization
  of black-box functions. When BO is used to optimize a target function, we often
  have access to previous evaluations of potentially related functions. This begs
  the question as to whether we can leverage these previous experiences to accelerate
  the current BO task through meta-learning (meta-BO), while ensuring robustness against
  potentially harmful dissimilar tasks that could sabotage the convergence of BO.
  This paper introduces two scalable and provably robust meta-BO algorithms: robust
  meta-Gaussian process-upper confidence bound (RM-GP-UCB) and RM-GP-Thompson sampling
  (RM-GP-TS). We prove that both algorithms are asymptotically no-regret even when
  some or all previous tasks are dissimilar to the current task, and show that RM-GP-UCB
  enjoys a better theoretical robustness than RM-GP-TS. We also exploit the theoretical
  guarantees to optimize the weights assigned to individual previous tasks through
  regret minimization via online learning, which diminishes the impact of dissimilar
  tasks and hence further enhances the robustness. Empirical evaluations show that
  (a) RM-GP-UCB performs effectively and consistently across various applications,
  and (b) RM-GP-TS, despite being less robust than RM-GP-UCB both in theory and in
  practice, performs competitively in some scenarios with less dissimilar tasks and
  is more computationally efficient.  '
