title: 'Quantum perceptron revisited: Computational-statistical tradeoffs'
abstract: Quantum machine learning algorithms could provide significant speed-ups
  over their classical counterparts; however, whether they could also achieve good
  generalization remains unclear. Recently, two quantum perceptron models which give
  a quadratic improvement over the classical perceptron algorithm using Groverâ€™s search
  have been proposed by Wiebe et al. While the first model reduces the complexity
  with respect to the size of the training set, the second one improves the bound
  on the number of mistakes made by the perceptron. In this paper, we introduce a
  hybrid quantum-classical perceptron algorithm with lower complexity and better generalization
  ability than the classical perceptron. We show a quadratic improvement over the
  classical perceptron in both the number of samples and the margin of the data. We
  derive a bound on the expected error of the hypothesis returned by our algorithm,
  which compares favorably to the one obtained with the classical online perceptron.
  We use numerical experiments to illustrate the trade-off between computational complexity
  and statistical accuracy in quantum perceptron learning and discuss some of the
  key practical issues surrounding the implementation of quantum perceptron models
  into near-term quantum devices, whose practical implementation represents a serious
  challenge due to inherent noise. However, the potential benefits make correcting
  this worthwhile.
