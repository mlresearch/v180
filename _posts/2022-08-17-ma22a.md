title: Data sampling affects the complexity of online SGD over dependent data
abstract: 'Conventional machine learning applications typically assume that data samples
  are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.). However, practical scenarios
  often involve a data-generating process that produces highly dependent data samples,
  which are known to heavily bias the stochastic optimization process and slow down
  the convergence of learning. In this paper, we conduct a fundamental study on how
  different stochastic data sampling schemes affect the sample complexity of online
  stochastic gradient descent (SGD) over highly dependent data. Specifically, with
  a $\phi$-mixing process of data, we show that online SGD with proper periodic data-subsampling
  achieves an improved sample complexity over the standard online SGD in the full
  spectrum of the data dependence level. Interestingly, even subsampling a subset
  of data samples can accelerate the convergence of online SGD over highly dependent
  data.  Moreover, we show that online SGD with mini-batch sampling can further substantially
  improve the sample complexity over online SGD with periodic data-subsampling over
  highly dependent data. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical results.  '
