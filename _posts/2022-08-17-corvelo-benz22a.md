title: Counterfactual inference of second Opinions
abstract: Automated decision support systems that are able to infer second opinions
  from experts can potentially facilitate a more efficient allocation of resourcesâ€”they
  can help decide when and from whom to seek a second opinion. In this paper, we look
  at the design of this type of support systems from the perspective of counterfactual
  inference. We focus on a multiclass classification setting and first show that,
  if experts make predictions on their own, the underlying causal mechanism generating
  their predictions needs to satisfy a desirable set invariant property. Further,
  we show that, for any causal mechanism satisfying this property, there exists an
  equivalent mechanism where the predictions by each expert are generated by independent
  sub-mechanisms governed by a common noise. This motivates the design of a set invariant
  Gumbel-Max structural causal model where the structure of the noise governing the
  sub-mechanisms underpinning the model depends on an intuitive notion of similarity
  between experts which can be estimated from data. Experiments on both synthetic
  and real data show that our model can be used to infer second opinions more accurately
  than its non-causal counterpart.
