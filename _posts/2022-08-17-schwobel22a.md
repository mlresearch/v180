title: Probabilistic spatial transformer networks
abstract: Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) estimate image transformations that
  can improve downstream tasks by ‘zooming in’ on relevant regions in an image. However,
  STNs are hard to train and sensitive to mis-predictions of transformations. To circumvent
  these limitations, we propose a probabilistic extension that estimates a stochastic
  transformation rather than a deterministic one. Marginalizing transformations allows
  us to consider each image at multiple poses, which makes the localization task easier
  and the training more robust. As an additional benefit, the stochastic transformations
  act as a localized, learned data augmentation that improves the downstream tasks.
  We show across standard imaging benchmarks and on a challenging real-world dataset
  that these two properties lead to improved classification performance, robustness
  and model calibration. We further demonstrate that the approach generalizes to non-visual
  domains by improving model performance on time-series data.
