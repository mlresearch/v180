title: 'PathFlow: A normalizing flow generator that finds transition paths'
abstract: 'Sampling from a Boltzmann distribution to calculate important macro statistics
  is one of the central tasks in the study of large atomic and molecular systems.  Recently,
  a one-shot configuration sampler, the Boltzmann generator  [Noé et al., 2019], is
  introduced. Though a Boltzmann generator can directly generate independent metastable
  states, it lacks the ability to find transition pathways and describe the whole
  transition process. In this paper, we propose PathFlow that can function as a one-shot
  generator as well as a transition pathfinder. More specifically, a normalizing flow
  model is constructed to map the base distribution and linear interpolated path in
  the latent space to the Boltzmann distribution and a minimum (free) energy path
  in the configuration space simultaneously. PathFlow can be trained by standard gradient-based
  optimizers using the proposed gradient estimator with a theoretical guarantee. PathFlow,
  validated with the extensively studied examples including a synthetic Müller potential
  and Alanine dipeptide, shows a remarkable performance. '
