title: Data augmentation in Bayesian neural networks and the cold posterior effect
abstract: Bayesian neural networks that incorporate data augmentation implicitly use
  a “randomly perturbed log-likelihood [which] does not have a clean interpretation
  as a valid likelihood function” (Izmailov et al. 2021). Here, we provide several
  approaches to developing principled Bayesian neural networks incorporating data
  augmentation. We introduce a “finite orbit” setting which allows valid likelihoods
  to be computed exactly, and for the more usual “full orbit” setting we derive multi-sample
  bounds tighter than those used previously. These models cast light on the origin
  of the cold posterior effect. In particular, we find that the cold posterior effect
  persists even in these principled models incorporating data augmentation. This suggests
  that the cold posterior effect cannot be dismissed as an artifact of data augmentation
  using incorrect likelihoods.
