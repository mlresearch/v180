title: Lifting in multi-agent systems under uncertainty
abstract: " A decentralised partially observable Markov decision problem (DecPOMDP)
  formalises collaborative multi-agent decision making. A solution to a DecPOMDP is
  a joint policy for the agents, fulfilling an optimality criterion such as maximum
  expected utility. A crux is that the problem is intractable regarding the number
  of agents. Inspired by lifted inference, this paper examines symmetries within the
  agent set for a potential tractability. Specifically, this paper contributes (i)
  specifications of counting and isomorphic symmetries, (ii) a compact encoding of
  symmetric DecPOMDPs as partitioned DecPOMDPs, and (iii) a formal analysis of complexity
  and tractability. This works allows tractability in terms of agent numbers and a
  new query type for isomorphic DecPOMDPs. "
