title: Reframed GES with a neural conditional dependence measure
abstract: In a nonparametric setting, the causal structure is often identifiable only
  up to Markov equivalence, and for the purpose of causal inference, it is useful
  to learn a graphical representation of the Markov equivalence class (MEC).  In this
  paper, we revisit the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algorithm, which is widely
  cited as a score-based algorithm for learning the MEC of the underlying causal structure.
  We observe that in order to make the GES algorithm consistent in a nonparametric
  setting, it is not necessary to design a scoring metric that evaluates graphs. Instead,
  it suffices to plug in a consistent estimator of a measure of conditional dependence
  to guide the search. We therefore present a reframing of the GES algorithm, which
  is more flexible than the standard score-based version and readily lends itself
  to the nonparametric setting with a general measure of conditional dependence. In
  addition, we propose a neural conditional dependence (NCD) measure, which utilizes
  the expressive power of deep neural networks to characterize conditional independence
  in a nonparametric manner. We establish the optimality of the reframed GES algorithm
  under standard assumptions and the consistency of using our NCD estimator to decide
  conditional independence. Together these results justify the proposed approach.
  Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in causal discovery,
  as well as the advantages of using our NCD measure over kernel-based measures.
