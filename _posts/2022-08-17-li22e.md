title: Efficient resource allocation with fairness constraints in restless multi-armed
  bandits
abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMAB) is an apt model to represent decision-making
  problems in public health interventions (e.g., tuberculosis, maternal, and child
  care), anti-poaching planning, sensor monitoring, personalized recommendations and
  many more. Existing research in RMAB has contributed mechanisms and theoretical
  results to a wide variety of settings, where the focus is on maximizing expected
  value. In this paper, we are interested in ensuring that RMAB decision making is
  also fair to different arms while maximizing expected value. In the context of public
  health settings, this would ensure that different people and/or communities are
  fairly represented while making public health intervention decisions. To achieve
  this goal, we formally define the fairness constraints in RMAB and provide planning
  and learning methods to solve RMAB in a fair manner. We demonstrate key theoretical
  properties of fair RMAB and experimentally demonstrate that our proposed methods
  handle fairness constraints without sacrificing significantly on solution quality.
