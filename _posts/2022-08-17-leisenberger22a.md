title: 'Fixing the Bethe approximation: How structural modifications in a graph improve
  belief propagation'
abstract: Belief propagation is an iterative method for inference in probabilistic
  graphical models. Its well-known relationship to a classical concept from statistical
  physics, the Bethe free energy, puts it on a solid theoretical foundation. If belief
  propagation fails to approximate the marginals, then this is often due to a failure
  of the Bethe approximation. In this work, we show how modifications in a graphical
  model can be a great remedy for fixing the Bethe approximation. Specifically, we
  analyze how the removal of edges influences and improves belief propagation, and
  demonstrate that this positive effect is particularly distinct for dense graphs.
