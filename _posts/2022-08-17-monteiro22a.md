title: 'Monotonicity regularization: Improved penalties and novel applications to
  disentangled representation learning and robust classification'
abstract: 'We study settings where gradient penalties are used alongside risk minimization
  with the goal of obtaining predictors satisfying different notions of monotonicity.
  Specifically, we present two sets of contributions. In the first part of the paper,
  we show that different choices of penalties define the regions of the input space
  where the property is observed. As such, previous methods result in models that
  are monotonic only in a small volume of the input space. We thus propose an approach
  that uses mixtures of training instances and random points to populate the space
  and enforce the penalty in a much larger region. As a second set of contributions,
  we introduce regularization strategies that enforce other notions of monotonicity
  in different settings. In this case, we consider applications, such as image classification
  and generative modeling, where monotonicity is not a hard constraint but can help
  improve some aspects of the model. Namely, we show that inducing monotonicity can
  be beneficial in applications such as: (1) allowing for controllable data generation,
  (2) defining strategies to detect anomalous data, and (3) generating explanations
  for predictions. Our proposed approaches do not introduce relevant computational
  overhead while leading to efficient procedures that provide extra benefits over
  baseline models.'
