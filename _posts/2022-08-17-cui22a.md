title: Variational message passing neural network for Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) inference
abstract: Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) inference is a fundamental task in probabilistic
  inference and belief propagation (BP) is a widely used algorithm for MAP inference.
  Though BP has been applied successfully to many different fields, it offers no performance
  guarantee and often performs poorly on loopy graphs. To improve the performance
  on loopy graphs and to scale up to large graphs, we propose a variational message
  passing neural network (V-MPNN), where we leverage both the power of neural networks
  in modeling complex functions and the well-established algorithmic theories on variational
  belief propagation. Instead of relying on a hand-crafted variational assumption,
  we propose a neural-augmented free energy where a general variational distribution
  is parameterized through a neural network. A message passing neural network is utilized
  for the minimization of neural-augmented free energy. Training of the MPNN is thus
  guided by neural-augmented free energy, without requiring exact MAP configurations
  as annotations. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed V-MPNN
  by comparing against both state-of-the-art training-free methods and training-based
  methods.
