title: Optimal control of partially observable Markov decision processes with finite
  linear temporal logic constraints
abstract: Autonomous agents often operate in environments where the state is partially
  observed. In addition to maximizing their cumulative reward, agents must execute
  complex tasks with rich temporal and logical structures. These tasks can be expressed  using
  temporal logic languages like finite linear temporal logic. This paper, for the
  first time, provides a structured framework for designing agent policies that maximize
  the reward while ensuring that the probability of satisfying the temporal logic
  specification is sufficiently high. We reformulate the problem as a constrained
  partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and  provide a novel approach
  that can leverage off-the-shelf unconstrained POMDP solvers for solving it. Our
  approach guarantees approximate optimality and constraint satisfaction with high
  probability. We demonstrate its effectiveness by implementing it on several models
  of interest.
