title: Multi-source domain adaptation via weighted joint distributions optimal transport
abstract: 'This work addresses the problem of domain adaptation on an unlabeled target
  dataset using knowledge from multiple labelled source datasets. Most current approaches
  tackle this problem by searching for an embedding that is invariant across source
  and target domains, which corresponds to searching for a universal classifier that
  works well on all domains. In this paper, we address this problem from a new perspective:
  instead of crushing diversity of the source distributions, we exploit it to adapt
  better to the target distribution. Our method, named Multi-Source Domain Adaptation
  via Weighted Joint Distribution Optimal Transport (MSDA-WJDOT), aims at finding
  simultaneously an Optimal Transport-based alignment between the source and target
  distributions and a re-weighting of the sources distributions. We discuss the theoret-
  ical aspects of the method and propose a conceptually simple algorithm. Numerical
  experiments indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of- the-art performance
  on simulated and real datasets.'
