title: Bayesian spillover graphs for dynamic networks
abstract: We present Bayesian Spillover Graphs (BSG), a novel method for learning
  temporal relationships, identifying critical nodes, and quantifying uncertainty
  for multi-horizon spillover effects in a dynamic system. BSG leverages both an interpretable
  framework via forecast error variance decompositions (FEVD) and comprehensive uncertainty
  quantification via Bayesian time series models to contextualize temporal relationships
  in terms of systemic risk and prediction variability. Forecast horizon hyperparameter
  h allows for learning both short-term and equilibrium state network behaviors. Experiments
  for identifying source and sink nodes under various graph and error specifications
  show significant performance gains against state-of-the-art Bayesian Networks and
  deep-learning baselines. Applications to real-world systems also showcase BSG as
  an exploratory analysis tool for uncovering indirect spillovers and quantifying
  systemic risk.
