title: Self-supervised representations for multi-view reinforcement learning
abstract: Learning policies from raw, pixel images are quite important for the real-world
  application of deep reinforcement learning (RL). Standard model-free RL algorithms
  focus on single-view settings and unify the representation learning and policy learning
  into an end-to-end training process. However, such a learning paradigm is sample-inefficiency
  and sensitive to hyper-parameters when supervised merely by the reward signals.
  Based on this, we present Self-Supervised Representations (S2R) for multi-view reinforcement
  learning, a sample-efficient representation learning method for learning features
  from high-dimensional images. In S2R, we introduce a representation learning framework
  and define a novel multi-view auxiliary objective based on the multi-view image
  states and Conditional Entropy Bottleneck (CEB) principle. We integrate S2R with
  the deep RL agent to learn robust representations that preserve task-relevant information
  while discarding task-irrelevant information and find optimal policies that maximize
  the expected return. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of S2R in the
  visual DeepMind Control (DMControl) suite and show its better performance on the
  default DMControl tasks and their variants by replacing the tasksâ€™ default background
  with a random image or natural video.
