title: Deep Dirichlet process mixture models
abstract: In this paper we propose the deep Dirichlet process mixture (DDPM) model,
  which is an unsupervised method that simultaneously performs clustering and feature
  learning. The traditional Dirichlet process mixture model can infer the number of
  mixture components, but its flexibility is restricted since the clustering is performed
  in the raw feature space. Our method alleviates this limitation by using the flow-based
  deep neural network to learn more expressive features. DDPM unifies Dirichlet processes
  and the flow-based model with Monte Carlo expectation-maximization, and uses Gibbs
  sampling to sample from the posterior. This combination allows our method to exploit
  the mutually beneficial relation between clustering and feature learning. The effectiveness
  of DDPM is demonstrated by thorough experiments in various synthetic and real-world
  datasets.
