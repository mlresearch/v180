title: Quadratic metric elicitation for fairness and beyond
abstract: Metric elicitation is a recent framework for eliciting classification performance
  metrics that best reflect implicit user preferences based on the task and context.
  However, available elicitation strategies have been limited to linear (or quasi-linear)
  functions of predictive rates, which can be practically restrictive for many applications
  including fairness. This paper develops a strategy for eliciting more flexible multiclass
  metrics defined by quadratic functions of rates, designed to reflect human preferences
  better. We show its application in eliciting quadratic violation-based group-fair
  metrics. Our strategy requires only relative preference feedback, is robust to noise,
  and achieves near-optimal query complexity. We further extend this strategy to eliciting
  polynomial metrics â€“ thus broadening the use cases for metric elicitation.
