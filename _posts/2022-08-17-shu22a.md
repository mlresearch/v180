title: Neural ensemble search via Bayesian sampling
abstract: Recently, neural architecture search (NAS) has been applied to automate
  the design of neural networks in real-world applications. A large number of algorithms
  have been developed to improve the search cost or the performance of the final selected
  architectures in NAS. Unfortunately, these NAS algorithms aim to select only one
  single well-performing architecture from their search spaces and thus have overlooked
  the capability of neural network ensemble (i.e., an ensemble of neural networks
  with diverse architectures) in achieving improved performance over a single final
  selected architecture. To this end, we introduce a novel neural ensemble search
  algorithm, called neural ensemble search via Bayesian sampling (NESBS), to effectively
  and efficiently select well-performing neural network ensembles from a NAS search
  space. In our extensive experiments, NESBS algorithm is shown to be able to achieve
  improved performance over state-of-the-art NAS algorithms while incurring a comparable
  search cost, thus indicating the superior performance of our NESBS algorithm over
  these NAS algorithms in practice.
