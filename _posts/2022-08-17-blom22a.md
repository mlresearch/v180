title: Robustness of model predictions under extension
abstract: Mathematical models of the real world are simplified representations of
  complex systems. A caveat to using mathematical models is that predicted causal
  effects and conditional independences may not be robust under model extensions,
  limiting applicability of such models. In this work, we consider conditions under
  which qualitative model predictions are preserved when two models are combined.
  Under mild assumptions, we show how to use the technique of causal ordering to efficiently
  assess the robustness of qualitative model predictions. We also characterize a large
  class of model extensions that preserve qualitative model predictions. For dynamical
  systems at equilibrium, we demonstrate how novel insights help to select appropriate
  model extensions and to reason about the presence of feedback loops. We illustrate
  our ideas with a viral infection model with immune responses.
