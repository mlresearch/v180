title: Detecting textual adversarial examples through randomized substitution and
  vote
abstract: A line of work has shown that natural text processing models are vulnerable
  to adversarial examples. Correspondingly, various defense methods are proposed to
  mitigate the threat of textual adversarial examples, \textit{e.g.} adversarial training,
  input transformations, detection, \textit{etc}. In this work, we treat the optimization
  process for synonym substitution based textual adversarial attacks as a specific
  sequence of word replacement, in which each word mutually influences other words.
  We identify that we could destroy such mutual interaction and eliminate the adversarial
  perturbation by randomly substituting a word with its synonyms. Based on this observation,
  we propose a novel textual adversarial example detection method, termed \textit{Randomized
  Substitution and Vote} (RS&V), which votes the prediction label by accumulating
  the logits of $k$ samples generated by randomly substituting the words in the input
  text with synonyms. The proposed RS&V is generally applicable to any existing neural
  networks without modification on the architecture or extra training, and it is orthogonal
  to prior work on making the classification network itself more robust. Empirical
  evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our RS&V could detect the
  textual adversarial examples more successfully than the existing detection methods
  while maintaining the high classification accuracy on benign samples.
