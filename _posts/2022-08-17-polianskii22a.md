title: 'Voronoi density estimator for high-dimensional data: Computation, compactification
  and convergence'
abstract: The Voronoi Density Estimator (VDE) is an established density estimation
  technique that adapts to the local geometry of data. However, its applicability
  has been so far limited to problems in two and three dimensions. This is because
  Voronoi cells rapidly increase in complexity as dimensions grow, making the necessary
  explicit computations infeasible. We define a variant of the VDE deemed Compactified
  Voronoi Density Estimator (CVDE), suitable for higher dimensions. We propose computationally
  efficient algorithms for numerical approximation of the CVDE and formally prove
  convergence of the estimated density to the original one. We implement and empirically
  validate the CVDE through a comparison with the Kernel Density Estimator (KDE).
  Our results indicate that the CVDE outperforms the KDE on sound and image data.
