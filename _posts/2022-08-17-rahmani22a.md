title: Clustering a union of linear subspaces via matrix factorization and innovation
  search
abstract: This paper focuses on the Matrix Factorization based Clustering (MFC) method  which
  is one of the few closed-form algorithms for the subspace clustering algorithm.
  Despite being simple, closed-form, and computation-efficient, MFC can outperform
  the other sophisticated subspace clustering methods in many challenging scenarios.
  We reveal the connection between MFC and the Innovation Pursuit (iPursuit) algorithm
  which was shown to be able to outperform the other spectral clustering based methods
  with a notable margin especially when the span of clusters are close. A novel theoretical
  study is presented which sheds light on the key performance factors of both algorithms
  (MFC/iPursuit) and  it is shown that both algorithms can be robust to notable intersections
  between the span of  clusters. Importantly, in contrast to the theoretical guarantees
  of other algorithms which emphasized on the distance between the subspaces as the
  key performance factor and without making the innovation assumption, it is shown
  that the performance of MFC/iPursuit mainly depends on the distance between the
  innovative components of the clusters.
