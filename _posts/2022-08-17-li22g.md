title: "$\\ell_∞$-Bounds of the MLE in the BTL Model under General Comparison Graphs"
abstract: The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model is a popular statistical approach for
  estimating the global ranking of a collection of items using pairwise comparisons.
  To ensure accurate ranking, it is essential to obtain precise estimates of the model
  parameters in the $\ell_{\infty}$-loss. The difficulty of this task depends crucially
  on the topology of the pairwise comparison graph over the given items. However,
  beyond very few well-studied cases, such as the complete and Erd{ö}s-R{é}nyi comparison
  graphs, little is known about the performance of the maximum likelihood estimator
  (MLE) of the BTL model parameters in the $\ell_{\infty}$-loss under more general
  graph topologies. In this paper, we derive novel, general upper bounds on the $\ell_{\infty}$
  estimation error of the BTL MLE that depend explicitly on the algebraic connectivity
  of the comparison graph, the maximal performance gap across items and the sample
  complexity. We demonstrate that the derived bounds perform well and in some cases
  are sharper compared to known results obtained using different loss functions and
  more restricted assumptions and graph topologies. We carefully compare our results
  to Yan et al. (2012), which is closest in spirit to our work. We further provide
  minimax lower bounds under $\ell_{\infty}$-error that nearly match the upper bounds
  over a class of sufficiently regular graph topologies. Finally, we study the implications
  of our $\ell_{\infty}$-bounds for efficient (offline) tournament design. We illustrate
  and discuss our findings through various examples and simulations.
