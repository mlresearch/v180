title: 'Causal inference with treatment measurement error: a nonparametric instrumental
  variable approach'
abstract: 'We propose a kernel-based nonparametric estimator for the causal effect
  when the cause is corrupted by error. We do so by generalizing estimation in the
  instrumental variable setting. Despite significant work on regression with measurement
  error, additionally handling unobserved confounding in the continuous setting is
  non-trivial: we have seen little prior work. As a by-product of our investigation,
  we clarify a connection between mean embeddings and characteristic functions, and
  how learning one simultaneously allows one to learn the other. This opens the way
  for kernel method research to leverage existing results in characteristic function
  estimation. Finally, we empirically show that our proposed method, MEKIV, improves
  over baselines and is robust under changes in the strength of measurement error
  and to the type of error distributions.'
