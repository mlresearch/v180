title: Learning a neural Pareto manifold extractor with constraints
abstract: 'Multi-objective optimization (MOO) problems require balancing competing
  objectives, often under constraints. The Pareto optimal solution set defines all
  possible optimal trade-offs over such objectives. In this work, we present a novel
  method for Pareto-front learning: inducing the full Pareto manifold at train-time
  so users can pick any desired optimal trade-off point at run-time. Our key insight
  is to exploit Fritz-John Conditions for a novel guided double gradient descent strategy.
  Evaluation on synthetic benchmark problems allows us to vary MOO problem difficulty
  in controlled fashion and measure accuracy \vs known analytic solutions. We further
  test scalability and generalization in learning optimal neural model parameterizations
  for Multi-Task Learning (MTL) on image classification. Results show consistent improvement
  in  accuracy and efficiency over prior MTL methods as well as techniques from operations
  research.'
