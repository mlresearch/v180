title: Differentially private SGDA for minimax problems
abstract: Stochastic gradient descent ascent (SGDA) and its variants have been the
  workhorse for solving minimax problems. However,  in contrast to the well-studied
  stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with differential privacy (DP) constraints,  there
  is  little work on understanding the generalization (utility)  of SGDA with DP constraints.
  In this paper, we use the algorithmic stability approach to establish the generalization
  (utility) of DP-SGDA in different settings. In particular, for the convex-concave
  setting, we prove that the DP-SGDA can achieve  an optimal utility rate in terms
  of the weak primal-dual population risk in both smooth and non-smooth cases. To
  our best knowledge, this is the first-ever-known result for DP-SGDA in the non-smooth
  case.  We further provide its  utility  analysis in   the nonconvex-strongly-concave
  setting which is  the  first-ever-known result in terms of the primal population
  risk.  The convergence and generalization results for this nonconvex setting  are
  new even in the non-private setting.  Finally,  numerical experiments are conducted
  to  demonstrate the effectiveness of DP-SGDA  for both convex and nonconvex cases.
