title: Inductive synthesis of finite-state controllers for POMDPs
abstract: 'We present a novel learning framework to obtain finite-state controllers
  (FSCs) for partially observable Markov decision processes and illustrate its applicability
  for indefinite-horizon specifications. Our framework builds on oracle-guided inductive
  synthesis to explore a design space compactly representing available FSCs. The inductive
  synthesis approach consists of two stages: The outer stage determines the design
  space, i.e., the set of FSC candidates, while the inner stage efficiently explores
  the design space. This framework is easily generalisable and shows promising results
  when compared to existing approaches. Experiments indicate that our technique is
  (i) competitive to state-of-the-art belief-based approaches for indefinite-horizon
  properties, (ii) yields smaller FSCs than existing methods for several POMDP models,
  and (iii) naturally treats multi-objective specifications.'
