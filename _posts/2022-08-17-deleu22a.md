title: Bayesian structure learning with generative flow networks
abstract: In Bayesian structure learning, we are interested in inferring a distribution
  over the directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure of Bayesian networks, from data.
  Defining such a distribution is very challenging, due to the combinatorially large
  sample space, and approximations based on MCMC are often required. Recently, a novel
  class of probabilistic models, called Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), have
  been introduced as a general framework for generative modeling of discrete and composite
  objects, such as graphs. In this work, we propose to use a GFlowNet as an alternative
  to MCMC for approximating the posterior distribution over the structure of Bayesian
  networks, given a dataset of observations. Generating a sample DAG from this approximate
  distribution is viewed as a sequential decision problem, where the graph is constructed
  one edge at a time, based on learned transition probabilities. Through evaluation
  on both simulated and real data, we show that our approach, called DAG-GFlowNet,
  provides an accurate approximation of the posterior over DAGs, and it compares favorably
  against other methods based on MCMC or variational inference.
