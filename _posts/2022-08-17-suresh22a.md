title: Marginal MAP estimation for inverse RL under occlusion with observer noise
abstract: We consider the problem of learning the behavioral preferences of an expert
  engaged in a task from noisy and partially-observable demonstrations. This is motivated
  by real-world applications such as a line robot learning from observing a human
  worker, where some observations are occluded by environmental elements. Furthermore,
  robotic perception tends to be imperfect and noisy. Previous techniques for inverse
  reinforcement learning (IRL) take the approach of either omitting the missing portions
  or inferring it as part of expectation-maximization, which tends to be slow and
  prone to local optima. We present a new method that generalizes the well-known Bayesian
  maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) IRL method by marginalizing the occluded portions of
  the trajectory. This is then extended with an observation model to account for perception
  noise. This novel application of marginal MAP (MMAP) to IRL significantly improves
  on the previous IRL technique under occlusion in both formative evaluations on a
  toy problem and in a summative evaluation on a produce sorting line task by a physical
  robot.
