title: Cross-domain adaptive transfer reinforcement \{learning based on state-action
  correspondence
abstract: Despite the impressive success achieved in various domains, deep reinforcement
  learning (DRL) is still faced with the sample inefficiency problem.  Transfer learning
  (TL), which leverages prior knowledge from different but related tasks to accelerate
  the target task learning, has emerged as a promising direction to improve RL efficiency.  The
  majority of prior work considers TL across tasks with the same state-action spaces,
  while transferring across domains with different state-action spaces is relatively
  unexplored.  Furthermore, such existing cross-domain transfer approaches only enable
  transfer from a single source policy, leaving open the important question of how
  to best transfer from multiple source policies. This paper proposes a novel framework
  called Cross-domain Adaptive Transfer (\alg) to accelerate DRL. \alg learns the
  state-action correspondence from each source task to the target task and adaptively
  transfers knowledge from multiple source task policies to the target policy. \alg
  can be easily combined with existing DRL algorithms and experimental results show
  that \alg significantly accelerates learning and outperforms other cross-domain
  transfer methods on multiple continuous action control tasks.
