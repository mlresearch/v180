title: Generalizing off-policy learning under sample selection bias
abstract: Learning personalized decision policies that generalize to the target population
  is of great relevance. Since training data is often not representative of the target
  population, standard policy learning methods may yield policies that do not generalize
  target population. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for learning
  policies that generalize to the target population. For this, we characterize the
  difference between the training data and the target population as a sample selection
  bias using a selection variable. Over an uncertainty set around this selection variable,
  we optimize the minimax value of a policy to achieve the best worst-case policy
  value on the target population. In order to solve the minimax problem, we derive
  an efficient algorithm based on a convex-concave procedure and prove convergence
  for parametrized spaces of policies such as logistic policies. We prove that, if
  the uncertainty set is well-specified, our policies generalize to the target population
  as they can not do worse than on the training data. Using simulated data and a clinical
  trial, we demonstrate that, compared to standard policy learning methods, our framework
  improves the generalizability of policies substantially.
