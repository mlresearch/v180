title: Intervention target estimation in the presence of latent variables
abstract: This paper considers the problem of estimating unknown intervention targets
  in causal directed acyclic graphs from observational and interventional data in
  the presence of latent variables. The focus is on linear structural equation models
  with soft interventions. The existing approaches to this problem involve performing
  extensive conditional independence tests, and they estimate the unknown intervention
  targets alongside learning the structure of the causal model in its entirety. This
  joint learning approach results in algorithms that are not scalable as graph sizes
  grow. This paper proposes an approach that does not necessitate learning the entire
  causal model and focuses on learning only the intervention targets. The key idea
  of this approach is leveraging the property that interventions impose sparse changes
  in the precision matrix of a linear model. The proposed framework consists of a
  sequence of precision difference estimation steps. Furthermore, the necessary knowledge
  to refine an observational Markov equivalence class (MEC) to an interventional MEC
  is inferred. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the scalability of the
  proposed algorithm and compare it with those of the existing approaches.
