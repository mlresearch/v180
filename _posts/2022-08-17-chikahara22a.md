title: Feature selection for discovering distributional treatment effect modifiers
abstract: " Finding the features relevant to the difference in treatment effects is
  essential to unveil the underlying causal mechanisms. Existing methods seek such
  features by measuring how greatly the feature attributes affect the degree of the
  {\\it conditional average treatment effect} (CATE). However, these methods may overlook
  important features because CATE, a measure of the average treatment effect, cannot
  detect differences in distribution parameters other than the mean (e.g., variance).
  To resolve this weakness of existing methods, we propose a feature selection framework
  for discovering {\\it distributional treatment effect modifiers}. We first formulate
  a feature importance measure that quantifies how strongly the feature attributes
  influence the discrepancy between potential outcome distributions. Then we derive
  its computationally efficient estimator and develop a feature selection algorithm
  that can control the type I error rate to the desired level. Experimental results
  show that our framework successfully discovers important features and outperforms
  the existing mean-based method.     "
