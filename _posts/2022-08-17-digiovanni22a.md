title: Balancing adaptability and non-exploitability in repeated games
abstract: 'We study the problem of adaptability in repeated games: simultaneously
  guaranteeing low regret for several classes of opponents. We add the constraint
  that our algorithm is non-exploitable, in that the opponent lacks an incentive to
  use an algorithm against which we cannot achieve rewards exceeding some “fair” value.
  Our solution is an expert algorithm (LAFF), which searches within a set of sub-algorithms
  that are optimal for each opponent class, and punishes evidence of exploitation
  by switching to a policy that enforces a fair solution. With benchmarks that depend
  on the opponent class, we first show that LAFF has sublinear regret uniformly over  these
  classes. Second, we show that LAFF discourages exploitation,  because exploitative
  opponents have linear regret.  To our knowledge, this work is the first to provide
  guarantees for both regret and non-exploitability in multi-agent learning.'
