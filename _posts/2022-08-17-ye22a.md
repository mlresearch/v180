title: 'Pareto navigation gradient descent: a first-order algorithm for optimization
  in pareto set'
abstract: Many modern machine learning applications, such as multi-task learning,
  require finding optimal model parameters to trade-off multiple objective functions
  that may conflict with each other. The notion of the Pareto set allows us to focus
  on the set of (often infinite number of) models that cannot be strictly improved.
  But it does not provide an actionable procedure for picking one or a few special
  models to return to practical users. In this paper, we consider optimization in
  Pareto set (OPT-in-Pareto), the problem of finding Pareto models that optimize an
  extra reference criterion function within the Pareto set. This function can either
  encode a specific preference from the users, or represent a generic diversity measure
  for obtaining a set of diversified Pareto models that are representative of the
  whole Pareto set. Unfortunately, despite being a highly useful framework, efficient
  algorithms for OPT-in-Pareto have been largely missing, especially for large-scale,
  non-convex, and non-linear objectives in deep learning. A naive approach is to apply
  Riemannian manifold gradient descent on the Pareto set, which yields a high computational
  cost due to the need for eigen-calculation of Hessian matrices. We propose a first-order
  algorithm that approximately solves OPT-in-Pareto using only gradient information,
  with both high practical efficiency and theoretically guaranteed convergence property.
  Empirically, we demonstrate that our method works efficiently for a variety of challenging
  multi-task-related problems.
