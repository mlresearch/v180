title: Causal discovery with heterogeneous observational data
abstract: We consider the problem of causal discovery (structure learning) from heterogeneous
  observational data. Most existing methods assume homogeneous sampling scheme and
  causal mechanism, which may lead to misleading conclusions when violated. We propose
  a novel approach that exploits data heterogeneity to infer possibly cyclic causal
  structures from causally insufficient systems. The core idea is to model the direct
  causal effects as functions of exogenous covariates that help explain sampling and
  causal heterogeneity. We investigate the structure identifiability properties of
  the proposed model. Structure learning is carried out in a fully Bayesian fashion,
  which provides natural uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its utility through
  extensive simulations and two real-world applications.
