title: Enhanced adaptive optics control with image to image translation
abstract: We aim to significantly enhance the science return of astronomical observatories,
  and in particular giant terrestrial optical telescopes. Observatories employ Adaptive
  Optics (AO) systems in order to acquire high sensitivity diffraction limited images
  of the sky. The incumbent “workhorse” for control of AO systems employs a linear
  real-time controller in a closed loop, with sensing of state performed via a (Shack-Hartmann)
  wavefront sensor (WFS). The actuators of a deformable mirror (DM) are driven, with
  the action performed in each iteration having a continuous representation as an
  array of DC voltages. The typical control regime is practical and scalable, nonetheless,
  there remains a residual uncompensated turbulence that leads to optical aberrations
  limiting the class of scientific assets that can be acquired. We have developed
  and trained a translational GAN model that accurately estimates residual perturbations
  from WFS images. Model inference occurs in 0.34 milliseconds using off-the-shelf
  GPU hardware, and is applicable for use in AO control where the control loop might
  be running at 500Hz. We develop an AO control regime with a second controller stage
  actuating a second DM controlled in an open loop according to the estimated residual
  turbulence. Using the open-source COMPASS tool for simulation, we are able to significantly
  improve the performance using our new regime.
