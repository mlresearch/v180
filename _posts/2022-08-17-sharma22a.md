title: 'SymNet 2.0: Effectively handling Non-Fluents and Actions in Generalized Neural
  Policies for RDDL Relational MDPs'
abstract: 'Relational MDPs (RMDPs) compactly represent an infinite set of MDPs with
  an unbounded number of objects. Solving an RMDP requires a generalized policy that
  applies to all instances of a domain. Recently, Garg et al. proposed SymNet for
  this task– it constructs a graph neural network that shares parameters across all
  instances in a domain, thus making it applicable to any instance in a zero-shot
  manner. Our analysis of SymNet reveals that it performs no better than random on
  1/4th of planning competition domains. The key reasons are its design choices: it
  misses important information during graph construction, leading to (1) poor generalizability,
  and (2) potential non-identifiability of different actions. In response, our solution,
  SymNet2.0, substantially augments SymNet’s graph construction approach by introducing
  additional nodes and edges which allow a better transfer of important information
  about a domain. It also improves SymNet’s action decoders with relevant information
  from objects to make different actions identifiable during scoring. Extensive experiments
  on twelve competition domains, where we use imitation learning over data generated
  from the PROST planner, demonstrate that SymNet2.0 performs vastly better than SymNet.
  Interestingly, even though SymNet2.0 is trained over data from PROST, it outperforms
  the planner on several test instances due to former’s ability to scale to large
  instances in a zero-shot manner.'
