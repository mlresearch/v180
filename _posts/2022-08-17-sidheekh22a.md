title: 'VQ-Flows: Vector quantized local normalizing flows'
abstract: Normalizing flows provide an elegant approach to  generative modeling that
  allows for efficient sampling and exact density  evaluation of unknown data distributions.
  However, current techniques have  significant limitations in their expressivity
  when the data distribution  is supported on a low-dimensional manifold or has a
  non-trivial topology.  We introduce a novel statistical framework for learning a
  mixture of  local normalizing flows as “chart maps” over the data manifold.  Our
  framework augments the expressivity of recent approaches while  preserving the signature
  property of normalizing flows, that they admit  exact density evaluation. We learn
  a suitable atlas of charts for the data  manifold via a vector quantized auto-encoder
  (VQ-AE) and the distributions  over them using a conditional flow. We validate experimentally
  that our  probabilistic framework enables existing approaches to better model data  distributions
  over complex manifolds.
