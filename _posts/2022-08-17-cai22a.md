title: 'AUTM flow: atomic unrestricted time machine for monotonic normalizing flows'
abstract: 'Nonlinear monotone transformations are used extensively in normalizing
  flows to construct invertible triangular mappings from simple distributions to complex
  ones. In existing literature, monotonicity is usually enforced by restricting function
  classes or model parameters and the inverse transformation is often approximated
  by root-finding algorithms as a closed-form inverse is unavailable. In this paper,
  we introduce a new integral-based approach termed: Atomic Unrestricted Time Machine
  (AUTM), equipped with unrestricted integrands and easy-to-compute explicit inverse.
  AUTM offers a versatile and efficient way to the design of normalizing flows with
  explicit inverse and unrestricted function classes or parameters. Theoretically,
  we present a constructive proof that AUTM is universal: all monotonic normalizing
  flows can be viewed as limits of AUTM flows. We provide a concrete example to show
  how to approximate any given monotonic normalizing flow using AUTM flows with guaranteed
  convergence. The result implies that AUTM can be used to transform an existing flow
  into a new one equipped with explicit inverse and unrestricted parameters. The performance
  of the new approach is evaluated on high dimensional density estimation, variational
  inference and image generation. Experiments demonstrate superior speed and memory
  efficiency of AUTM.'
