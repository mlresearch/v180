title: Sublinear time algorithms for greedy selection in high dimensions
abstract: 'Greedy selection is a widely used idea for solving many machine learning
  problems. But greedy selection algorithms often have high complexities and thus
  may be prohibitive for large-scale data. In this paper, we consider two fundamental
  optimization problems in machine learning: k-center clustering and convex hull approximation,
  where they both can be solved via greedy selection. We propose sublinear time algorithms
  for them through combining the strategies of randomization and greedy selection.
  Our results are similar in spirit to the linear time stochastic greedy selection
  algorithms for submodular maximization, but with several important differences.
  Our runtimes are independent of the number of input data items n. In particular,
  our runtime for k-center clustering significantly improves upon that of the uniform
  sampling approach, especially when the dimensionality is high. Our sublinear algorithms
  can also reduce the computational complexities for various applications, such as
  data selection and compression, active learning, and topic modeling, etc.'
