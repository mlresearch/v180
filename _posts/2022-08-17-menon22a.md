title: Forget-me-not! Contrastive critics for mitigating posterior collapse
abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) suffer from posterior collapse, where the
  powerful neural networks used for modeling and inference optimize the objective
  without meaningfully using the latent representation. We introduce inference critics
  that detect and incentivize against posterior collapse by requiring correspondence
  between latent variables and the observations. By connecting the criticâ€™s objective
  to the literature in self-supervised contrastive representation learning, we show
  both theoretically and empirically that optimizing inference critics increases the
  mutual information between observations and latents, mitigating posterior collapse.
  This approach is straightforward to implement and requires significantly less training
  time than prior methods, yet obtains competitive results on three established datasets.
  Overall, the approach lays the foundation to bridge the previously disconnected
  frameworks of contrastive learning and probabilistic modeling with variational autoencoders,
  underscoring the benefits both communities may find at their intersection.
