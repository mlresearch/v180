title: A geometric method for improved uncertainty estimation in real-time
abstract: 'Machine learning classifiers are probabilistic in nature, and thus inevitably
  involve uncertainty. Predicting the probability of a specific input to be correct
  is called uncertainty (or confidence) estimation and is crucial for risk management.Post-hoc
  model calibrations can improve models’ uncertainty estimations without the need
  for retraining, and without changing the model.Our work puts forward a geometric-based
  approach for uncertainty estimation. Roughly speaking, we use the geometric distance
  of the current input from the existing training inputs as a signal for estimating
  uncertainty and then calibrate that signal (instead of the model’s estimation) using
  standard post-hoc calibration techniques.  We show that our method yields better
  uncertainty estimations than recently proposed approaches by extensively evaluating
  multiple datasets and models. In addition, we also demonstrate the possibility of
  performing our approach in near real-time applications. Our code is available at
  our Github: https://github.com/NoSleepDeveloper/Geometric-Calibrator '
