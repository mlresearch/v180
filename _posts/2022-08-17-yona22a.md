title: Active learning with label comparisons
abstract: Supervised learning typically relies on manual annotation of the true labels.
  When there are many potential classes, searching for the best one can be prohibitive
  for a human annotator. On the other hand, comparing two candidate labels is often
  much easier. We focus on this type of pairwise supervision and ask how it can be
  used effectively in learning, and in particular in active learning. We obtain several
  insightful results in this context. In principle, finding the best of k labels can
  be done with k-1 active queries. We show that there is a natural class where this
  approach is sub-optimal, and that there is a more comparison-efficient active learning
  scheme. A key element in our analysis is the “label neighborhood graph” of the true
  distribution, which has an edge between two classes if they share a decision boundary.
  We also show that in the PAC setting, pairwise comparisons cannot provide improved
  sample complexity in the worst case. We complement our theoretical results with
  experiments, clearly demonstrating the effect of the neighborhood graph on sample
  complexity.
