title: Conditional simulation using diffusion Schrödinger bridges
abstract: Denoising diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful class of
  generative models. They provide state-of-the-art results, not only for unconditional
  simulation, but also when used to solve conditional simulation problems arising
  in a wide range of inverse problems. A limitation of these models is that they are
  computationally intensive at generation time as they require simulating a diffusion
  process over a long time horizon. When performing unconditional simulation, a Schr{ö}dinger
  bridge formulation of generative modeling leads to a theoretically grounded algorithm
  shortening generation time which is complementary to other proposed acceleration
  techniques. We extend the Schrödinger bridge framework to conditional simulation.
  We demonstrate this novel methodology on various applications including image super-resolution,
  optimal filtering for state-space models and the refinement of pre-trained networks.
