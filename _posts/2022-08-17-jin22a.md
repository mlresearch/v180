title: Orthogonal Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancy with efficient lower bound
abstract: Comparing structured data from possibly different metric-measure spaces
  is a fundamental task in machine learning, with applications in, e.g., graph classification.
  The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) discrepancy formulates a coupling between the structured
  data based on optimal transportation, tackling the incomparability between different
  structures by aligning the intra-relational geometries. Although efficient local
  solvers such as conditional gradient and Sinkhorn are available, the inherent non-convexity
  still prevents a tractable evaluation, and the existing lower bounds are not tight
  enough for practical use. To address this issue, we take inspirations from the connection
  with the quadratic assignment problem, and propose the orthogonal Gromov-Wasserstein
  (OGW) discrepancy as a surrogate of GW.  It admits an efficient and closed-form
  lower bound with O(n^3) complexity, and directly extends to the fused Gromov-Wasserstein
  distance, incorporating node features into the coupling.  Extensive experiments
  on both the synthetic and real-world datasets show the tightness of our lower bounds,
  and both OGW and its lower bounds efficiently deliver accurate predictions and satisfactory
  barycenters for graph sets.
