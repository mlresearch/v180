title: Mitigating statistical bias within differentially private synthetic data
abstract: Increasing interest in privacy-preserving machine learning has led to new
  and evolved approaches for generating private synthetic data from undisclosed real
  data. However, mechanisms of privacy preservation can significantly reduce the utility
  of synthetic data, which in turn impacts downstream tasks such as learning predictive
  models or inference. We propose several re-weighting strategies using privatised
  likelihood ratios that not only mitigate statistical bias of downstream estimators
  but also have general applicability to differentially private generative models.
  Through large-scale empirical evaluation, we show that private importance weighting
  provides simple and effective privacy-compliant augmentation for general applications
  of synthetic data.
