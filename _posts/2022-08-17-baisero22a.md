title: Asymmetric DQN for partially observable reinforcement learning
abstract: Offline training in simulated partially observable environments allows reinforcement
  learning methods to exploit privileged state information through a mechanism known
  as asymmetry. Such privileged information has the potential to greatly improve the
  optimal convergence properties, if used appropriately. However, current research
  in asymmetric reinforcement learning is often heuristic in nature, with few connections
  to underlying theory or theoretical guarantees, and is primarily tested through
  empirical evaluation. In this work, we develop the theory of Asymmetric Policy Iteration,
  an exact model-based dynamic programming solution method, and then apply relaxations
  which eventually result in Asymmetric DQN, a model-free deep reinforcement learning
  algorithm. Our theoretical findings are complemented and validated by empirical
  experimentation performed in environments which exhibit significant amounts of partial
  observability, and require both information gathering strategies and memorization.
