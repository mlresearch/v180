title: Information theoretic approach to detect collusion in multi-agent games
abstract: Collusion in a competitive multi-agent game occurs when two or more agents
  co-operate covertly to the disadvantage of others. Most competitive multi-agent
  games do not allow players to share information and explicitly prohibit collusion.
  In this paper, we present a novel way of detecting collusion using a domain-independent
  information-theoretic approach. Specifically, we show that the use of mutual information
  between actions of the agents provides a good indication of collusive behavior.
  Our experiments show that our method can detect varying levels of collusion in repeated
  simultaneous games like iterated Rock Paper Scissors. We further extend the detection
  to partially observable sequential games like poker and show the effectiveness of
  our methodology.
