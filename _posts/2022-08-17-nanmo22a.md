title: Partially adaptive regularized multiple regression analysis for estimating
  linear causal effects
abstract: This paper assumes that cause-effect relationships among variables can be
  described with a linear structural equation model. Then, a situation is considered
  where a set of observed covariates satisfies the back-door criterion but the ordinary
  least squares method cannot be applied to estimate linear causal effects because
  of multicollinearity/high-dimensional data problems. In this situation, we propose
  a novel regression approach, the “partially adaptive L$_p$-regularized multiple
  regression analysis” (PAL$_p$MA) method for estimating the total effects. Different
  from standard regularized regression analysis, PAL$_p$MA provides a consistent or
  less-biased estimator of the linear causal effect. PAL$_p$MA is also applicable
  to evaluating direct effects through the single-door criterion.  Given space constraints,
  the proofs, some numerical experiments, and an industrial case study on setting
  up painting conditions of car bodies are provided in the Supplementary Material.
