title: Faster non-convex federated learning via global and local momentum
abstract: 'We propose \texttt{FedGLOMO}, a novel federated learning (FL) algorithm
  with an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ to converge to an
  $\epsilon$-stationary point (i.e., $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla f(x)\|^2] \leq \epsilon$)
  for smooth non-convex functions – under arbitrary client heterogeneity and compressed
  communication – compared to the $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ complexity of most
  prior works. Our key algorithmic idea that enables achieving this improved complexity
  is based on the observation that the convergence in FL is hampered by two sources
  of high variance: (i) the global server aggregation step with multiple local updates,
  exacerbated by client heterogeneity, and (ii) the noise of the local client-level
  stochastic gradients. The first issue is particularly detrimental to FL algorithms
  that perform plain averaging at the server. By modeling the server aggregation step
  as a generalized gradient-type update, we propose a variance-reducing momentum-based
  global update at the server, which when applied in conjunction with variance-reduced
  local updates at the clients, enables \texttt{FedGLOMO} to enjoy an improved convergence
  rate. Our experiments illustrate the intrinsic variance reduction effect of \texttt{FedGLOMO},
  which implicitly suppresses client-drift in heterogeneous data distribution settings
  and promotes communication efficiency.'
