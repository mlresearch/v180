title: 'Dynamic relocation in ridesharing via fixpoint construction '
abstract: To address spatial imbalances in the supply and demand of drivers, ridesharing
  platforms can make use of policies to direct driver relocation.  We study a simple
  model of this problem, which allows us to give a constructive characterization of
  the unique fixpoint of system dynamics.  Using this construction, we design a dynamic
  policy that provides stronger, than previous work,  guarantees about its rate of
  convergence to the fixpoint.  Simulations demonstrate the benefits of our approach.
