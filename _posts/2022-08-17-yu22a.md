title: Learning binary multi-scale games on networks
abstract: Network games are a natural modeling framework for strategic interactions
  of agents whose actions have local impact on others. Recently, a multi-scale network
  game model has been proposed to capture local effects at multiple network scales,
  such as among both individuals and groups. We propose a framework to learn the utility
  functions of binary multi-scale games from agentsâ€™ behavioral data. Departing from
  much prior work in this area, we model agent behavior as following logit-response
  dynamics, rather than acting according to a Nash equilibrium. This defines a generative
  time-series model  of joint behavior of both agents and groups, which enables us
  to naturally cast the learning problem as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We
  show that in the important special case of multi-scale linear-quadratic games, this
  MLE problem is convex. Extensive experiments using both synthetic and real data
  demonstrate that our proposed modeling and learning approach is effective in both
  game parameter estimation as well as prediction of future behavior, even when we
  learn the game from only a single behavior time series. Furthermore, we show how
  to use our framework to develop a statistical test for the existence of multi-scale
  structure in the game, and use it to demonstrate that real time-series data indeed
  exhibits such structure.
