title: Physics guided neural networks for spatio-temporal super-resolution of turbulent
  flows
abstract: Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent flows is computationally
  expensive and cannot be applied to flows with large Reynolds numbers.  Low-resolution
  large eddy simulation (LES) is a popular alternative, but it is unable to capture
  all of the scales of turbulent transport accurately. Reconstructing DNS from low-resolution
  LES is critical for large-scale simulation in many scientific and engineering disciplines,
  but it poses many challenges to existing super-resolution methods due to the complexity
  of turbulent flows and computational cost of generating frequent LES data.  We propose
  a physics-guided neural network for reconstructing frequent DNS from sparse LES
  data by enhancing its spatial resolution and temporal frequency. Our proposed method
  consists of a partial differential equation (PDE)-based recurrent unit for capturing
  underlying temporal processes and a physics-guided super-resolution model that incorporates
  additional physical constraints.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of both components
  in reconstructing the Taylor-Green Vortex using sparse LES data. Moreover, we show
  that the proposed recurrent unit can preserve the physical characteristics of turbulent
  flows by leveraging the physical relationships in the Navier-Stokes equation.
