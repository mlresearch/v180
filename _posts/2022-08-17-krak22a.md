title: Hitting times for continuous-time imprecise-Markov chains
abstract: We study the problem of characterizing the expected hitting times for a
  robust generalization of continuous-time Markov chains. This generalization is based
  on the theory of imprecise probabilities, and the models with which we work essentially
  constitute sets of stochastic processes. Their inferences are tight lower- and upper
  bounds with respect to variation within these sets.  We consider three distinct
  types of these models, corresponding to different levels of generality and structural
  independence assumptions on the constituent processes.  Our main results are twofold;
  first, we demonstrate that the hitting times for all three types are equivalent.
  Moreover, we show that these inferences are described by a straightforward generalization
  of a well-known linear system of equations that characterizes expected hitting times
  for traditional time-homogeneous continuous-time Markov chains.
