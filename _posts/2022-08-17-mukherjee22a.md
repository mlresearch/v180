title: Safety aware changepoint detection for piecewise i.i.d. bandits
abstract: In this paper, we consider the setting of piecewise i.i.d. bandits under
  a safety constraint. In this piecewise i.i.d. setting, there exists a finite number
  of changepoints where the mean of some or all arms change simultaneously. We introduce
  the safety constraint studied in Wu et al. (2016) to this setting such that at any
  round the cumulative reward is above a constant factor of the default action reward.
  We propose two actively adaptive algorithms for this setting that satisfy the safety
  constraint, detect changepoints, and restart without the knowledge of the number
  of changepoints or their locations. We provide regret bounds for our algorithms
  and show that the bounds are comparable to their counterparts from the safe bandit
  and piecewise i.i.d. bandit literature. We also provide the first matching lower
  bounds for this setting.  Empirically, we show that our safety-aware algorithms
  match the performance of the state-of-the-art actively adaptive algorithms that
  do not satisfy the safety constraint.
