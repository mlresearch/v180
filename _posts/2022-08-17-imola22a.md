title: Balancing utility and scalability in metric differential privacy
abstract: Metric differential privacy (mDP) is a modification of differential privacy
  that is more suitable when records can be represented in a general metric space,
  such as text data represented as word embed- dings or geographical coordinates on
  a map. We consider the task of releasing elements of the metric space under metric
  differential privacy where utility is measured as the distance of the released element
  to the original element. Linear programming (LP) can be used to construct a mechanism
  that achieves the optimal utility for a particular mDP constraint. However, these
  LPs suffer from a polynomial explosion of variables and constraints that render
  them impractical for solving real-world problems. An important question is how to
  design rigorous mDP mechanisms that balance the utility- scalability tradeoff. Our
  main contribution is a new method for reducing the LP size used to generate mDP
  mechanisms by constraining the search space such that certain input and output pairs
  have transition probabilities derived from the exponential mechanism. Our method
  produces mDP mechanisms whose LPs are smaller that all prior work in this area.
  We also provide a lower bound on the best possible mechanism utility. Our experiments
  on real-world metric spaces highlight the superior utility-scalability tradeoff
  of our mechanism.
