title: Noisy L0-sparse subspace clustering on dimensionality reduced data
abstract: Sparse subspace clustering methods with sparsity induced by L0-norm, such
  as L0-Sparse Subspace Clustering (L0-SSC), are demonstrated to be more effective
  than its L1 counterpart such as Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC). However, the theoretical
  analysis of L0-SSC is restricted to clean data that lie exactly in subspaces. Real
  data often suffer from noise and they may lie close to subspaces. In this paper,
  we show that an optimal solution to the optimization problem of noisy L0-SSC achieves
  subspace detection property (SDP), a key element with which data from different
  subspaces are separated, under deterministic and semi-random model. Our results
  provide theoretical guarantee on the correctness of noisy L0-SSC in terms of SDP
  on noisy data for the first time, which reveals the advantage of noisy L0-SSC in
  terms of much less restrictive condition on subspace affinity. In order to improve
  the efficiency of noisy L0-SSC, we propose Noisy-DR-L0-SSC which provably recovers
  the subspaces on dimensionality reduced data. Noisy-DR-L0-SSC first projects the
  data onto a lower dimensional space by random projection, then performs noisy L0-SSC
  on the dimensionality reduced data for improved efficiency. Experimental results
  demonstrate the effectiveness of Noisy-DR-L0-SSC.
