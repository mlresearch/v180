title: 'Quantification of Credal Uncertainty in Machine Learning: A Critical Analysis
  and Empirical Comparison'
abstract: The representation and quantification of uncertainty has received increasing
  attention in machine learning in the recent past. The formalism of credal sets provides
  an interesting alternative in this regard, especially as it combines the representation
  of epistemic (lack of knowledge) and aleatoric (statistical) uncertainty in a rather
  natural way. In this paper, we elaborate on uncertainty measures for credal sets
  from the perspective of machine learning. More specifically, we provide an overview
  of proposals, discuss existing measures in a critical way, and also propose a new
  measure that is more tailored to the machine learning setting. Based on an experimental
  study, we conclude that theoretically well-justified measures also lead to better
  performance in practice. Besides, we corroborate the difficulty of the disaggregation
  problem, that is, of decomposing the amount of total uncertainty into aleatoric
  and epistemic uncertainty in a sound manner, thereby complementing theoretical findings
  with empirical evidence.
