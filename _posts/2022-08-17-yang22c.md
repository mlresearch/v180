title: Robust textual embedding against word-level adversarial attacks
abstract: We attribute the vulnerability of natural language processing models to
  the fact that similar inputs are converted to dissimilar representations in the
  embedding space, leading to inconsistent outputs, and we propose a novel robust
  training method, termed \textit{Fast Triplet Metric Learning (FTML)}.  Specifically,
  we argue that the original sample should have similar representation with its adversarial
  counterparts and distinguish its representation from other samples for better robustness.
  To this end, we adopt the triplet metric learning into the standard training to
  pull words closer to their positive samples (\textit{i.e.}, synonyms) and push away
  their negative samples (\textit{i.e.}, non-synonyms) in the embedding space. Extensive
  experiments demonstrate that FTML can significantly promote the model robustness
  against various advanced adversarial attacks while keeping competitive classification
  accuracy on original samples. Besides, our method is efficient as it only needs
  to adjust the embedding and introduces very little overhead on the standard training.
  Our work shows great potential of improving the textual robustness through robust
  word embedding.
