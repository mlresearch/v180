title: 'SENTINEL: taming uncertainty with ensemble based distributional reinforcement
  learning'
abstract: In this paper, we consider risk-sensitive sequential decision-making in
  Reinforcement Learning (RL).  Our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce
  a novel and coherent quantification of risk, namely composite risk, which quantifies
  the joint effect of aleatory and epistemic risk during the learning process. Existing
  works considered either aleatory or epistemic risk individually, or as an additive
  combination. We prove that the additive formulation is a particular case of the
  composite risk when the epistemic risk measure is replaced with expectation. Thus,
  the composite risk is more sensitive to both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty
  than the individual and additive formulations. We also propose an algorithm, SENTINEL-K,
  based on ensemble bootstrapping and distributional RL for representing epistemic
  and aleatory uncertainty respectively. The ensemble of K learners uses Follow The
  Regularised Leader (FTRL) to aggregate the return distributions and obtain the composite
  risk. We experimentally verify that SENTINEL-K estimates the return distribution
  better, and while used with composite risk estimates, demonstrates higher risk-sensitive
  performance than state-of-the-art risk-sensitive and distributional RL algorithms.
