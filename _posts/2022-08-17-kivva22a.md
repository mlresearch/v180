title: Revisiting the general identifiability problem
abstract: We revisit the problem of general identifiability originally introduced
  in [Lee et al., 2019] for causal inference and note that it is necessary to add
  positivity assumption of observational distribution to the original definition of
  the problem. We show that without such an assumption the rules of do-calculus and
  consequently the proposed algorithm in [Lee et al., 2019] are not sound. Moreover,
  adding the assumption will cause the completeness proof in [Lee et al., 2019] to
  fail. Under positivity assumption, we present a new algorithm that is provably both
  sound and complete. A nice property of this new algorithm is that it establishes
  a connection between  general identifiability and classical identifiability by Pearl
  [1995] through decomposing the general identifiability problem into a series of
  classical identifiability  sub-problems.
