title: High-probability bounds for robust stochastic Frank-Wolfe algorithm
abstract: We develop and analyze robust Stochastic Frank-Wolfe type algorithms for
  projection-free stochastic convex optimization problems with heavy-tailed stochastic
  gradients. Existing works on the oracle complexity of such algorithms require a
  uniformly bounded variance assumption, and hold only in expectation. We develop
  tight high-probability bounds for robust versions of Stochastic Frank-Wolfe type
  algorithm under heavy-tailed assumptions, including infinite variance, on the stochastic
  gradient. Our methodological construction of the robust Stochastic Frank-Wolfe type
  algorithms leverage techniques from the robust statistic literature. Our theoretical
  analysis highlights the need to utilize robust versions of Stochastic Frank-Wolfe
  type algorithm for dealing with heavy-tailed data arising in practice.
