title: Empirical bayes approach to truth discovery problems
abstract: When aggregating information from conflicting sources, one’s goal is to
  find the truth. Most real-value truth discovery (TD) algorithms try to achieve this
  goal by estimating the competence of each source and then aggregating the conflicting
  information by weighing each source’s answer proportionally to her competence. However,
  each of those algorithms requires more than a single source for such estimation
  and usually does not consider different estimation methods other than a weighted
  mean. Therefore, in this work we formulate, prove, and empirically test the conditions
  for an Empirical Bayes Estimator (EBE) to dominate the weighted mean aggregation.
  Our main result demonstrates that EBE, under mild conditions, can be used as a second
  step of any TD algorithm in order to reduce the expected error.
