title: 'ST-MAML : A stochastic-task based method for task-heterogeneous meta-learning'
abstract: Optimization-based meta-learning typically assumes tasks are sampled from
  a single distribution - an assumption that oversimplifies and limits the diversity
  of tasks that meta-learning can model. Handling tasks from multiple distributions
  is challenging for meta-learning because it adds ambiguity to task identities. This
  paper proposes a novel method, ST-MAML, that empowers model-agnostic meta-learning
  (MAML) to learn from multiple task distributions. ST-MAML encodes tasks using a
  stochastic neural network module, that summarizes every task with a stochastic representation.
  The proposed Stochastic Task (ST) strategy learns a distribution of solutions for
  an ambiguous task and allows a meta-model to self-adapt to the current task. ST-MAML
  also propagates the task representation to enhance input variable encodings. Empirically,
  we demonstrate that ST-MAML outperforms the state-of-the-art on two few-shot image
  classification tasks, one curve regression benchmark, one image completion problem,
  and a real-world temperature prediction application.
