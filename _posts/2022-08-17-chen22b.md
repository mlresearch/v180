title: 'Stackmix: a complementary mix algorithm'
abstract: 'Techniques combining multiple images as input/output have proven to be
  effective data augmentations for training convolutional neural networks. In this
  paper, we present StackMix: each input is presented as a concatenation of two images,
  and the label is the mean of the two one-hot labels. On its own, StackMix rivals
  other widely used methods in the “Mix” line of work. More importantly, unlike previous
  work, significant gains across a variety of benchmarks are achieved by combining
  StackMix with existing Mix augmentation, effectively mixing more than two images.
  E.g., by combining StackMix with CutMix, test error in the supervised setting is
  improved across a variety of settings over CutMix, including 0.8% on ImageNet, 3%
  on Tiny ImageNet, 2% on CIFAR-100, 0.5% on CIFAR-10, and 1.5% on STL-10. Similar
  results are achieved with Mixup. We further show that gains hold for robustness
  to common input corruptions and perturbations at varying severities with a 0.7%
  improvement on CIFAR-100-C, by combining StackMix with AugMix over AugMix. On its
  own, improvements with StackMix hold across different number of labeled samples
  on CIFAR-100, maintaining approximately a 2% gap in test accuracy –down to using
  only 5% of the whole dataset– and is effective in the semi-supervised setting with
  a 2% improvement with the standard benchmark Pi-model. Finally, we perform an extensive
  ablation study to better understand the proposed methodology.'
