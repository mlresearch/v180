title: Future gradient descent for adapting the temporal shifting data distribution
  in online recommendation systems
abstract: One of the key challenges of learning an online recommendation model is
  the temporal domain shift, which causes the mismatch between the training and testing
  data distribution and hence domain generalization error. To overcome, we propose
  to learn a meta future gradient generator that forecasts the gradient information
  of the future data distribution for training so that the recommendation model can
  be trained as if we were able to look ahead at the future of its deployment. Compared
  with Batch Update, a widely used paradigm, our theory suggests that the proposed
  algorithm achieves smaller temporal domain generalization error measured by a gradient
  variation term in a local regret. We demonstrate the empirical advantage by comparing
  with various representative baselines.
