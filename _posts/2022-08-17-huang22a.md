title: Uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling for quantum calculations
abstract: 'Machine learning models have recently shown promise in predicting molecular
  quantum chemical properties. However, the path to real-life adoption requires (1)
  learning under low-resource constraints and (2) out-of-distribution generalization
  to unseen, structurally diverse molecules. We observe that these two challenges
  can be addressed via abundant labels, which is often not the case in quantum chemistry.
  We hypothesize that pseudo-labeling on a vast array of unlabeled molecules can serve
  as gold-label proxies to expand the training labeled dataset significantly. The
  challenge in pseudo-labeling is to prevent the bad pseudo-labels from biasing the
  model. Motivated by the entropy minimization framework, we develop a simple and
  effective strategy Pseudo that can assign pseudo-labels, detect bad pseudo-labels
  through evidential uncertainty, and prevent them from biasing the model using adaptive
  weighting. Empirically, Pseudo improves quantum calculations accuracy in full data,
  low data, and out-of-distribution settings. '
