title: 'NeuroBE: Escalating neural network approximations of Bucket Elimination'
abstract: A major limiting factor in graphical model inference is the complexity of
  computing the partition function. Exact message-passing algorithms such as Bucket
  Elimination (BE) require exponential memory to compute the partition function; therefore,
  approximations are necessary. In this paper, we build upon a recently introduced
  methodology called Deep Bucket Elimination (DBE) that uses classical Neural Networks
  to approximate messages generated by BE for large buckets. The main feature of our
  new scheme, renamed NeuroBE, is that it customizes the architecture of the neural
  networks, their learning process and in particular, adapts the loss function to
  the internal form or distribution of messages. Our experiments demonstrate significant
  improvements in accuracy and time compared with the earlier DBE scheme.
