title: Identifying near-optimal decisions in linear-in-parameter  bandit models with
  continuous decision sets
abstract: We consider an online optimization problem in a bandit  setting in which
  a learner chooses decisions from a continuous decision  set at discrete decision
  epochs, and receives noisy rewards from the  environment in response. While the
  noise samples are assumed to be  independent and sub-Gaussian, the mean reward at
  each epoch is a fixed but  unknown linear function of a feature vector, which depends
  on the decision  through a known (and possibly nonlinear)  feature map. We study
  the  problem within the framework of best-arm identification with fixed  confidence,
  and provide a template algorithm for approximately learning  the optimal decision
  in a probably approximately correct (PAC) setting.  More precisely, the template
  algorithm samples the decision space till a  stopping condition is met,  and returns
  a subset of decisions such that,  with the required confidence, every element of
  the subset is approximately  optimal for the unknown mean reward function.  We provide
  a sample  complexity bound for the template algorithm and then specialize it to
  the  case where the mean-reward function is a univariate polynomial of a single  decision
  variable. We provide an implementable algorithm for this case by  explicitly instantiating
  all the steps in the template algorithm. Finally,  we provide experimental results
  to demonstrate the efficacy of our  algorithms.
