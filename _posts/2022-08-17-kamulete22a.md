title: Test for non-negligible adverse shifts
abstract: 'Statistical tests for dataset shift are susceptible to false alarms: they
  are sensitive to minor differences when there is in fact adequate sample coverage
  and predictive performance. We propose instead a framework to detect adverse shifts
  based on outlier scores, D-SOS for short. D-SOS holds that the new (test) sample
  is not substantively worse than the reference (training) sample, and not that the
  two are equal. The key idea is to reduce observations to outlier scores and compare
  contamination rates at varying weighted thresholds. Users can define what worse
  means in terms of relevant notions of outlyingness, including proxies for predictive
  performance. Compared to tests of equal distribution, our approach is uniquely tailored
  to serve as a robust metric for model monitoring and data validation. We show how
  versatile and practical D-SOS is on a wide range of real and simulated data.'
