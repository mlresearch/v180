title: 'Offline stochastic shortest path: Learning, evaluation and towards optimality'
abstract: Goal-oriented Reinforcement Learning, where the agent needs to reach the
  goal state while simultaneously minimizing the cost, has received significant attention
  in real-world applications. Its theoretical formulation, stochastic shortest path
  (SSP), has been intensively researched in the online setting. Nevertheless, it remains
  understudied when such an online interaction is prohibited and only historical data
  is provided. In this paper, we consider the offline stochastic shortest path problem
  when the state space and the action space are finite. We design the simple value
  iteration-based algorithms for tackling both offline policy evaluation (OPE) and
  offline policy learning tasks. Notably, our analysis of these simple algorithms
  yields strong instance-dependent bounds which can imply worst-case bounds that are
  near-minimax optimal. We hope our study could help illuminate the fundamental statistical
  limits of the offline SSP problem and motivate further studies beyond the scope
  of current consideration.
