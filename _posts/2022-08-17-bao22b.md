title: Byzantine-tolerant distributed multiclass sparse linear discriminant analysis
abstract: Communication cost and security issues are both important in large-scale
  distributed machine learning. In this paper, we investigate a multiclass sparse
  classification problem under two distributed systems. We propose two distributed
  multiclass sparse discriminant analysis algorithms based on mean-aggregation and
  median-aggregation under the normal distributed system or Byzantine failure system.
  Both of them are computation and communication efficient. Several theoretical results,
  including estimation error bounds, and support recovery, are established. With moderate
  initial estimators, our iterative estimators achieve a (near-)optimal rate and exact
  support recovery after a constant number of rounds. Experiments on both synthetic
  and real datasets are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
  methods.
