title: Semi-supervised novelty detection using ensembles with regularized disagreement
abstract: 'Deep neural networks often predict samples with high confidence even when
  they come from unseen classes and should instead be flagged for expert evaluation.  Current
  novelty detection algorithms cannot reliably identify such near OOD points unless
  they have access to labeled data that is similar to these novel samples. In this
  paper, we develop a new ensemble-based procedure for semi-supervised novelty detection
  (SSND) that successfully leverages a mixture of unlabeled ID and novel-class samples
  to achieve good detection performance.  In particular, we show how to achieve disagreement
  only on OOD data using early stopping regularization. While we prove this fact for
  a simple data distribution, our extensive experiments suggest that it holds true
  for more complex scenarios: our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
  SSND methods on standard image data sets (SVHN/CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100) and medical image
  data sets with only a negligible increase in computation cost.'
