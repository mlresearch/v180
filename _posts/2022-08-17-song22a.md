title: Mutual information based Bayesian graph neural network for few-shot learning
abstract: In the deep neural network based few-shot learning, the limited training
  data may make the neural network extract ineffective features, which leads to inaccurate
  results. By Bayesian graph neural network (BGNN), the probability distributions
  on hidden layers imply useful features, and the few-shot learning could improved
  by establishing the correlation among features. Thus, in this paper, we incorporate
  mutual information (MI) into BGNN to describe the correlation, and propose an innovative
  framework by adopting the Bayesian network with continuous variables (BNCV) for
  effective calculation of MI. First, we build the BNCV simultaneously when calculating
  the probability distributions of features from the Dropout in hidden layers of BGNN.
  Then, we approximate the MI values efficiently by probabilistic inferences over
  BNCV. Finally, we give the correlation based loss function and training algorithm
  of our BGNN model. Experimental results show that our MI based BGNN framework is
  effective for few-shot learning and outperforms some state-of-the-art competitors
  by large margins on accuracy.
