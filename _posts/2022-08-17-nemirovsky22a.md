title: 'CounteRGAN: Generating counterfactuals for real-time recourse and interpretability
  using residual GANs'
abstract: 'Model interpretability, fairness, and recourse for end users have increased
  as machine learning models have become increasingly popular in areas including criminal
  justice, finance, healthcare, and job marketplaces. This work presents a novel method
  of addressing these issues by producing meaningful counterfactuals that are aimed
  at providing recourse to users and highlighting potential model biases. A meaningful
  counterfactual is a reasonable alternative scenario that illustrates how input data
  perturbations can influence the modelâ€™s output. The CounteRGAN method generates
  meaningful counterfactuals for a target classifier by utilizing a novel Residual
  Generative Adversarial Network (RGAN). We compare our method against leading state-of-the-art
  approaches on image and tabular datasets over a variety of performance metrics.
  The results indicate a significant improvement over existing techniques in combined
  metric performance, with a latency reduction of 2 to 7 orders of magnitude which
  enables providing real-time recourse to users. The code for reproducibility can
  be found here: https://github.com/gan-counterfactuals/countergan.'
