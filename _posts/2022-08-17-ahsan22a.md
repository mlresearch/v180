title: Non-parametric inference of relational dependence
abstract: Independence testing plays a central role in statistical and causal inference
  from observational data. Standard independence tests assume that the data samples
  are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) but that assumption is violated
  in many real-world datasets and applications centered on relational systems. This
  work examines the problem of estimating independence in data drawn from relational
  systems by defining sufficient representations for the sets of observations influencing
  individual instances. Specifically, we define marginal and conditional independence
  tests for relational data by considering the kernel mean embedding as a flexible
  aggregation function for relational variables. We propose a consistent, non-parametric,
  scalable kernel test to operationalize the relational independence test for non-i.i.d.
  observational data under a set of structural assumptions. We empirically evaluate
  our proposed method on a variety of synthetic and semi-synthetic networks and demonstrate
  its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art kernel-based independence tests.
