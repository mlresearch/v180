title: AND/OR branch-and-bound for computational protein design optimizing K*
abstract: The importance of designing proteins, such as high affinity antibodies,
  has become ever more apparent.  Computational Protein Design can cast such design
  problems as optimization tasks with the objective of maximizing K*, an approximation
  of binding affinity.  Here we lay out a graphical model framework for K* optimization
  that enables use of compact AND/OR search algorithms. We designed an AND/OR branch-and-bound
  algorithm, AOBB-K*, for optimizing K* that is guided by a new K* heuristic and can
  incorporate specialized performance improvements with theoretical guarantees. As
  AOBB-K* is inspired by algorithms from the well studied task of Marginal MAP, this
  work provides a foundation for harnessing advancements in state-of-the-art mixed
  inference schemes and adapting them to protein design.
