title: Greedy modality selection via approximate submodular maximization
abstract: Multimodal learning considers learning from multi-modality data, aiming
  to fuse heterogeneous sources of information. However, it is not always feasible
  to leverage all available modalities due to memory constraints. Further, training
  on all the modalities may be inefficient when redundant information exists within
  data, such as different subsets of modalities providing similar performance. In
  light of these challenges, we study modality selection, intending to efficiently
  select the most informative and complementary modalities under certain computational
  constraints. We formulate a theoretical framework for optimizing modality selection
  in multimodal learning and introduce a utility measure to quantify the benefit of
  selecting a modality. For this optimization problem, we present efficient algorithms
  when the utility measure exhibits monotonicity and approximate submodularity. We
  also connect the utility measure with existing Shapley-value-based feature importance
  scores. Last, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm on synthetic (Patch-MNIST)
  and real-world (PEMS-SF, CMU-MOSI) datasets.
