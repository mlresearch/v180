title: Can mean field control (mfc) approximate cooperative multi agent reinforcement
  learning (marl) with non-uniform interaction?
abstract: Mean-Field Control (MFC) is a powerful tool to solve Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning (MARL) problems. Recent studies have shown that MFC can well-approximate
  MARL when the population size is large and the agents are exchangeable. Unfortunately,
  the presumption of exchangeability implies that all agents uniformly interact with
  one another which is not true in many practical scenarios. In this article, we relax
  the assumption of exchangeability and model the interaction between agents via an
  arbitrary doubly stochastic matrix. As a result, in our framework, the mean-field
  ‘seen’ by different agents are different. We prove that, if the reward of each agent
  is an affine function of the mean-field seen by that agent, then one can approximate
  such a non-uniform MARL problem via its associated MFC problem within an error of
  $e=\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}[\sqrt{|\mathcal{X}|} + \sqrt{|\mathcal{U}|}])$
  where $N$ is the population size and $|\mathcal{X}|$, $|\mathcal{U}|$ are the sizes
  of state and action spaces respectively. Finally, we develop a Natural Policy Gradient
  (NPG) algorithm that can provide a solution to the non-uniform MARL with an error
  $\mathcal{O}(\max\{e,\epsilon\})$ and a sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$
  for any $\epsilon >0$.
