title: 'Causal forecasting: generalization bounds for autoregressive models'
abstract: 'Despite the increasing relevance of forecasting methods, causal implications
  of these algorithms remain largely unexplored. This is concerning considering that,
  even under simplifying assumptions such as causal sufficiency, the statistical risk
  of a model can differ significantly from its causal risk. Here, we study the problem
  of causal generalization—generalizing from the observational to interventional distributions—in
  forecasting. Our goal is to find answers to the question: How does the efficacy
  of an autoregressive (VAR) model in predicting statistical associations compare
  with its ability to predict under interventions? To this end, we introduce the framework
  of causal learning theory for forecasting. Using this framework, we obtain a characterization
  of the difference between statistical and causal risks, which helps identify sources
  of divergence between them. Under causal sufficiency, the problem of causal generalization
  amounts to learning under covariate shifts albeit with additional structure (restriction
  to interventional distributions under the VAR model). This structure allows us to
  obtain uniform convergence bounds on causal generalizability for the class of VAR
  models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides theoretical
  guarantees for causal generalization in the time-series setting.'
