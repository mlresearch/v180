title: 'Local calibration: metrics and recalibration'
abstract: Probabilistic classifiers output confidence scores along with their predictions,
  and these confidence scores should be calibrated, i.e., they should reflect the
  reliability of the prediction. Confidence scores that minimize standard metrics
  such as the expected calibration error (ECE) accurately measure the reliability
  \textit{on average} across the entire population. However, it is in general impossible
  to measure the reliability of an \textit{individual} prediction. In this work, we
  propose the local calibration error (LCE) to span the gap between average and individual
  reliability. For each individual prediction, the LCE measures the average reliability
  of a set of similar predictions, where similarity is quantified by a kernel function
  on a pretrained feature space and by a binning scheme over predicted model confidences.
  We show theoretically that the LCE can be estimated sample-efficiently from data,
  and empirically find that it reveals miscalibration modes that are more fine-grained
  than the ECE can detect. Our key result is a novel {\textbf{lo}cal \textbf{re}calibration}
  method \method{}, to improve confidence scores for individual predictions and decrease
  the LCE. Experimentally, we show that our recalibration method produces more accurate
  confidence scores, which improves downstream fairness and decision making on classification
  tasks with both image and tabular data.
