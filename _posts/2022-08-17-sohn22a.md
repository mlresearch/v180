title: Fast inference and transfer of compositional task structures for few-shot task
  generalization
abstract: We tackle real-world problems with complex structures beyond the pixel-based
  game or simulator. We formulate it as a few-shot reinforcement learning problem
  where a task is characterized by a subtask graph that defines a set of subtasks
  and their dependencies that are unknown to the agent. Different from the previous
  meta-RL methods trying to directly infer the unstructured task embedding, our multi-task
  subtask graph inferencer (MTSGI) first infers the common high-level task structure
  in terms of the subtask graph from the training tasks, and use it as a prior to
  improve the task inference in testing. Our experiment results on 2D grid-world and
  complex web navigation domains show that the proposed method can learn and leverage
  the common underlying structure of the tasks for faster adaptation to the unseen
  tasks than various existing algorithms such as meta reinforcement learning, hierarchical
  reinforcement learning, and other heuristic agents.
