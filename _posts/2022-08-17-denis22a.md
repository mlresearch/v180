title: Multiclass classification for Hawkes processes
abstract: We investigate the multiclass classification prob- lem where the features
  are event sequences. More precisely, the data are assumed to be generated by a mixture
  of simple linear Hawkes processes. In this new setting, the classes are discriminated
  by various triggering kernels. A challenge is then to build an efficient classification
  procedure. We de- rive the optimal Bayes rule and provide a two-step estimation
  procedure of the Bayes classifier. In the first step, the weights of the mixture
  are estimated; in the second step, an empirical risk minimization procedure is performed
  to estimate the parameters of the Hawkes processes. We establish the consis- tency
  of the resulting procedure and derive rates of convergence. Finally, the numerical
  properties of the data-driven algorithm are illustrated through a simulation study
  where the triggering kernels are assumed to belong to the popular parametric expo-
  nential family. It highlights the accuracy and the robustness of the proposed algorithm.
  In particular, even if the underlying kernels are misspecified, the procedure exhibits
  good performance.
