title: Convergence Analysis of Linear Coupling with Inexact Proximal Operator
abstract: Linear coupling is recently proposed to accelerate first-order algorithms
  by linking gradient descent and mirror descent together, which is able to achieve
  the accelerated convergence rate for first-order algorithms. This work focuses on
  the convergence analysis of linear coupling for convex composite minimization when
  the proximal operator cannot be exactly computed. It is of particular interest to
  study the convergence of linear coupling because it not only achieves the accelerated
  convergence rate for first-order algorithm but also works for generic norms. We
  present convergence analysis of linear coupling by allowing the proximal operator
  to be computed up to a certain precision. Our analysis illustrates that the accelerated
  convergence rate of linear coupling with inexact proximal operator can be preserved
  if the error sequence of inexact proximal operator decreases in a sufficiently fast
  rate. More importantly, our analysis leads to better bounds than existing works
  on inexact proximal operator. Experiment results on several real-world datasets
  verify our theoretical results.
