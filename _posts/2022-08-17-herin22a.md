title: Learning sparse representations of preferences within Choquet expected utility
  theory
abstract: 'This paper deals with preference elicitation within Choquet Expected Utility
  (CEU) theory for decision making under uncertainty. We consider the Savageâ€™s framework
  with a finite set of states and assume that preferences of the Decision Maker over
  acts are observable. The CEU model involves two parameters that must be tuned to
  the value system of the decision maker: a set function (capacity) modeling weights
  attached to events, of size exponential in the number of states, and a utility function
  defined on the space of outcomes.  Our aim is to learn a sparse representation of
  the CEU model from preference data.  We propose and test a preference learning approach
  based on a spline representation of utilities and the sparse learning of capacities
  to obtain CEU models achieving a good tradeoff between the aim of sparsity and the
  expressivity required by preference data.'
