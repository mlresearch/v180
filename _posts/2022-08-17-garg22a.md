title: Estimating transfer entropy under long ranged dependencies
abstract: Estimating Transfer Entropy (TE) between time series is a highly impactful  problem
  in fields such as finance and neuroscience. The well-known nearest neighbor estimator
  of TE potentially fails if temporal dependencies are noisy and long ranged, primarily
  because it estimates TE indirectly relying on the estimation of joint entropy terms
  in high dimensions, which is a hard problem in itself. Other estimators, such as
  those based on Copula entropy or conditional mutual information have similar limitations.
  Leveraging the successes of modern discriminative models that operate in high dimensional
  (noisy) feature spaces, we express TE as a difference of two conditional entropy
  terms, which we directly estimate from conditional likelihoods computed in-sample
  from any discriminator (timeseries forecaster) trained per maximum likelihood principle.
  To ensure that the in-sample log likelihood estimates are not overfit to the data,
  we propose a novel perturbation model based on locality sensitive hash (LSH) functions,
  which regularizes a discriminative model to have smooth functional outputs within
  local neighborhoods of the input space. Our estimator is consistent, and its variance
  reduces linearly in sample size. We also demonstrate its superiority w.r.t. state-of-the-art
  estimators through empirical evaluations on a synthetic as well as real world datasets
  from the neuroscience and finance domains.
