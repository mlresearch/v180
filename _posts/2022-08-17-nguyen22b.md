title: Efficient and accurate top-k recovery from choice data
abstract: The intersection of learning to rank and choice modeling is an active area
  of research with applications in e-commerce, information retrieval and the social
  sciences. In some applications such as recommendation systems, the statistician
  is primarily interested in recovering the set of the top ranked items from a large
  pool of items as efficiently as possible using passively collected discrete choice
  data, i.e., the user picks one item from a set of multiple items. Motivated by this
  practical consideration, we propose the choice-based Borda count algorithm as a
  fast and accurate ranking algorithm for top $K$-recovery i.e., correctly identifying
  all of the top $K$ items. We show that the choice-based Borda count algorithm has
  optimal sample complexity for top-$K$ recovery under a broad class of random utility
  models. We prove that in the limit, the choice-based Borda count algorithm produces
  the same top-$K$ estimate as the commonly used Maximum Likelihood Estimate method
  but the formerâ€™s speed and simplicity brings considerable advantages in practice.
  Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that the counting algorithm
  is competitive with commonly used ranking algorithms in terms of accuracy while
  being several orders of magnitude faster.
