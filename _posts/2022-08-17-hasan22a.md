title: Modeling extremes with $d$-max-decreasing neural networks
abstract: We propose a neural network architecture that enables non-parametric calibration
  and generation of multivariate extreme value distributions (MEVs).  MEVs arise from
  Extreme Value Theory (EVT) as the necessary class of models when extrapolating a
  distributional fit over large spatial and temporal scales based on data observed
  in intermediate scales.  In turn, EVT dictates that $d$-max-decreasing, a stronger
  form of convexity, is an essential shape constraint in the characterization of MEVs.  As
  far as we know, our proposed architecture provides the first class of non-parametric
  estimators for MEVs that preserve these essential shape constraints.  We show that
  the architecture approximates the dependence structure encoded by MEVs at parametric
  rate.  Moreover, we present a new method for sampling high-dimensional MEVs using
  a generative model.  We demonstrate our methodology on a wide range of experimental
  settings, ranging from environmental sciences to financial mathematics and verify
  that the structural properties of MEVs are retained compared to existing methods.
