title: 'CoSPA: An improved masked language model with copy mechanism for Chinese spelling
  correction'
abstract: Existing BERT-based models for Chinese spelling correction (CSC) have three
  issues. 1) Bert tends to rectify a correct low-frequency collocation into a high-frequency
  one and leads to over-correcting. 2) It fails to completely detect phonic or morphological
  errors by the current learned similarity knowledge between Chinese characters, and
  the recall rate still has room to improve. 3) Two-dimensional glyph information
  of Chinese characters is overlooked and some morphological misused characters may
  be difficult to detect. This paper proposes a hybrid approach, CoSPA, to address
  these issues. 1) This paper proposes an alterable copy mechanism to alleviate over-correcting
  by jointly learning to copy a correct character from input sentence, or generate
  a character from BERT. No method has used copy mechanism in BERT for CSC. 2) The
  attention mechanism is further applied on the phonic and shape representation of
  each character at the output layer. 3) Shape representation is enhanced by mining
  character glyph with ResNet, and fused with stroke representation via an adaptive
  gating unit. The experimental results show that CoSPA outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
  methods on SIGHAN2015 datasets.
