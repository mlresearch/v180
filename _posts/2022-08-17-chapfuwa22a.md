title: Capturing actionable dynamics with structured latent ordinary differential
  equations
abstract: End-to-end learning of dynamical systems with black-box models, such as
  neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), provides a flexible framework for
  learning dynamics from data without prescribing a mathematical model for the dynamics.
  Unfortunately, this flexibility comes at the cost of understanding the dynamical
  system, for which ODEs are used ubiquitously. Further, experimental data are collected
  under various conditions (inputs), such as treatments, or grouped in some way, such
  as part of sub-populations. Understanding the effects of these system inputs on
  system outputs is crucial to have any meaningful model of a dynamical system. To
  that end, we propose a structured latent ODE model that explicitly captures system
  input variations within its latent representation. Building on a static latent variable
  specification, our model learns (independent) stochastic factors of variation for
  each input to the system, thus separating the effects of the system inputs in the
  latent space. This approach provides actionable modeling through the controlled
  generation of time-series data for novel input combinations (or perturbations).
  Additionally, we propose a flexible approach for quantifying uncertainties, leveraging
  a quantile regression formulation. Results on challenging biological datasets show
  consistent improvements over competitive baselines in the controlled generation
  of observational data and inference of biologically meaningful system inputs.
