title: 'ResIST: Layer-wise decomposition of ResNets for distributed training'
abstract: We propose ResIST, a novel distributed training protocol for Residual Networks
  (ResNets). ResIST randomly decomposes a global ResNet into several shallow sub-ResNets
  that are trained independently in a distributed manner for several local iterations,
  before having their updates synchronized and aggregated into the global model. In
  the next round, new sub-ResNets are randomly generated and the process repeats until
  convergence. By construction, per iteration, ResIST communicates only a small portion
  of network parameters to each machine and never uses the full model during training.
  Thus, ResIST reduces the per-iteration communication, memory, and time requirements
  of ResNet training to only a fraction of the requirements of full-model training.
  In comparison to common protocols, like data-parallel training and data-parallel
  training with local SGD, ResIST yields a decrease in communication and compute requirements,
  while being competitive with respect to model performance.
