title: Reinforcement learning in many-agent settings under partial observability
abstract: Recent renewed interest in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has
  generated an impressive array of techniques that leverage deep RL, primarily actor-critic
  architectures, and can be applied to a limited range of settings in terms of observability
  and communication. However, a continuing limitation of much of this work is the
  curse of dimensionality when it comes to representations based on joint actions,
  which grow exponentially with the number of agents. In this paper, we squarely focus
  on this challenge of scalability. We apply the key insight of action anonymity to
  a recently presented actor-critic based MARL algorithm, interactive A2C. We introduce
  a Dirichlet-multinomial model for maintaining beliefs over the agent population
  when agentsâ€™ actions are not perfectly observable. We show that the posterior is
  a mixture of Dirichlet distributions that we approximate as a single component for
  tractability. We also show that the prediction accuracy of this method increases
  with more agents. Finally we show empirically that our method can learn optimal
  behaviors in two recently introduced pragmatic domains with large agent population,
  and demonstrates robustness in partially observable environments.
