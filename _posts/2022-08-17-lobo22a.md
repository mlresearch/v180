title: Data poisoning attacks on off-policy policy evaluation methods
abstract: Off-policy Evaluation (OPE) methods are a crucial tool for evaluating policies
  in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, where exploration is often infeasible,
  unethical, or expensive. However, the extent to which such methods can be trusted
  under adversarial threats to data quality is largely unexplored. In this work, we
  make the first attempt at investigating the sensitivity of OPE methods to marginal
  adversarial perturbations to the data. We design a generic data poisoning attack
  framework leveraging influence functions from robust statistics to carefully construct
  perturbations that maximize error in the policy value estimates. We carry out extensive
  experimentation with multiple healthcare and control datasets. Our results demonstrate
  that many existing OPE methods are highly prone to generating value estimates with
  large errors when subject to data poisoning attacks, even for small adversarial
  perturbations. These findings question the reliability of policy values derived
  using OPE methods and motivate the need for developing OPE methods that are statistically
  robust to train-time data poisoning attacks.
