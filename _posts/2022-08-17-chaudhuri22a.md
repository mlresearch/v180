title: Privacy-aware compression for federated data analysis
abstract: Federated data analytics is a framework for distributed data analysis where
  a server compiles noisy responses from a group of distributed low-bandwidth user
  devices to estimate aggregate statistics. Two major challenges in this framework
  are privacy, since user data is often sensitive, and compression, since the user
  devices have low network bandwidth. Prior work has addressed these challenges separately
  by combining standard compression algorithms with known privacy mechanisms. In this
  work, we take a holistic look at the problem and design a family of privacy-aware
  compression mechanisms that work for any given communication budget. We first propose
  a mechanism for transmitting a single real number that has optimal variance under
  certain conditions. We then show how to extend it to metric differential privacy
  for location privacy use-cases, as well as vectors, for application to federated
  learning. Our experiments illustrate that our mechanism can lead to better utility
  vs. compression trade-offs for the same privacy loss in a number of settings.
