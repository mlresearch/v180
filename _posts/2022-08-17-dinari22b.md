title: 'Revisiting DP-Means: fast scalable algorithms via parallelism and delayed
  cluster creation'
abstract: DP-means, a nonparametric generalization of  K-means, extends the latter
  to the  case where the number of clusters is unknown. Unlike K-means, however, DP-means
  is hard to parallelize, a limitation hindering its usage in large-scale tasks. This
  work bridges this practicality gap by rendering the DP-means approach a viable,
  fast, and highly-scalable solution. First, we study the strengths and weaknesses
  of previous attempts to parallelize the DP-means algorithm. Next, we propose a new
  parallel algorithm, called PDC-DP-Means (Parallel Delayed Cluster DP-Means), based
  in part on delayed creation of clusters. Compared with DP-Means, PDC-DP-Means provides
  not only a major speedup but also performance gains. Finally, we propose two extensions
  of PDC-DP-Means. The first combines it with an existing method, leading to further
  speedups. The second extends PDC-DP-Means to  a Mini-Batch setting (with an optional
  support for an online mode),  allowing for another major speedup. We verify the
  utility of the proposed methods on multiple datasets. We also show that the proposed
  methods outperform other nonparametric methods (e.g., DBSCAN). Our highly-efficient
  code can be used to reproduce our experiments and is available at https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/pdc-dp-means
