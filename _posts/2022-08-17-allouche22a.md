title: Multi-winner approval voting goes epistemic
abstract: Epistemic voting interprets votes as noisy signals about a ground truth.
  We consider contexts where the truth consists of a set of objective winners, knowing
  a lower and upper bound on its cardinality. A prototypical problem for this setting
  is the aggregation of multi-label annotations with prior knowledge on the size of
  the ground truth. We posit noise models, for which we define rules that output an
  optimal set of winners. We report on experiments on multi-label annotations (which
  we collected).
