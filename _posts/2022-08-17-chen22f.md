title: On the definition and computation of causal treewidth
abstract: Causal treewidth is a recently introduced notion allowing one to speed up
  Bayesian network inference and to bound its complexity in the presence of functional
  dependencies (causal mechanisms) whose identities are unknown. Causal treewidth
  is no greater than treewidth and can be bounded even when treewidth is unbounded.
  The utility of causal treewidth has been illustrated recently in the context of
  causal inference and model-based supervised learning. However, the current definition
  of causal treewidth is descriptive rather than perspective, therefore limiting its
  full exploitation in a practical setting. We provide an extensive study of causal
  treewidth in this paper which moves us closer to realizing the full computational
  potential of this notion both theoretically and practically.
