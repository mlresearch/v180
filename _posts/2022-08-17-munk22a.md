title: Probabilistic surrogate networks for simulators with unbounded randomness
abstract: We present a framework for automatically structuring and training fast,
  approximate, deep neural surrogates of stochastic simulators. Unlike traditional
  approaches to surrogate modeling, our surrogates retain the interpretable structure
  and control flow of the reference simulator. Our surrogates target stochastic simulators
  where the number of random variables itself can be stochastic and potentially unbounded.
  Our framework further enables an automatic replacement of the reference simulator
  with the surrogate when undertaking amortized inference. The fidelity and speed
  of our surrogates allow for both faster stochastic simulation and accurate and substantially
  faster posterior inference. Using an illustrative yet non-trivial example we show
  our surrogates’ ability to accurately model a probabilistic program with an unbounded
  number of random variables. We then proceed with an example that shows our surrogates
  are able to accurately model a complex structure like an unbounded stack in a program
  synthesis example. We further demonstrate how our surrogate modeling technique makes
  amortized inference in complex black-box simulators an order of magnitude faster.
  Specifically, we do simulator-based materials quality testing, inferring safety-critical
  latent internal temperature profiles of composite materials undergoing curing.
