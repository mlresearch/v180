title: Robust Bayesian recourse
abstract: Algorithmic recourse aims to recommend an informative feedback to overturn
  an unfavorable machine learning decision. We introduce in this paper the Bayesian
  recourse, a model-agnostic recourse that minimizes the posterior probability odds
  ratio. Further, we present its min-max robust counterpart with the goal of hedging
  against future changes in the machine learning model parameters. The robust counterpart
  explicitly takes into account possible perturbations of the data in a Gaussian mixture
  ambiguity set prescribed using the optimal transport (Wasserstein) distance. We
  show that the resulting worst-case objective function can be decomposed into solving
  a series of two-dimensional optimization subproblems, and the min-max recourse finding
  problem is thus amenable to a gradient descent algorithm. Contrary to existing methods
  for generating robust recourses, the robust Bayesian recourse does not require a
  linear approximation step. The numerical experiment demonstrates the effectiveness
  of our proposed robust Bayesian recourse facing model shifts. Our code is available
  at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/robust-bayesian-recourse.
