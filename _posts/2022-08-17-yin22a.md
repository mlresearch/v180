title: 'Superposing many tickets into one: A performance booster for sparse neural
  network training'
abstract: 'Recent works on sparse neural network training have shown that a compelling
  trade-off between performance and efficiency can be achieved. Existing sparse training
  methods usually strive to find the best sparse subnetwork possible in one single
  run, without involving any expensive dense or pre-training steps. For instance,
  dynamic sparse training (DST), as one of the most prominent directions,  is capable
  of reaching a competitive performance of dense training by iteratively evolving
  the sparse topology during the course of training. In this paper, we argue that
  it is better to allocate the limited resources to create multiple low-loss sparse
  subnetworks and superpose them into a stronger one, instead of allocating all resources
  entirely to find an individual subnetwork. To achieve this, two desiderata are required:
  (1) efficiently producing many low-loss subnetworks, the so-called cheap tickets,
  within one training process limited to the standard training time used in dense
  training; (2) effectively superposing these cheap tickets into one stronger subnetwork
  without going over the constrained parameter budget. To corroborate our conjecture,
  we present a novel sparse training approach, termed \textbf{Sup-tickets}, which
  can satisfy the above two desiderata concurrently in a single sparse-to-sparse training
  process. Across various models on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, we show that Sup-tickets
  integrates seamlessly with the existing sparse training methods and demonstrates
  consistent performance improvement.'
