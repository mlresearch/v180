title: Identifiability of sparse causal effects using instrumental variables
abstract: Exogenous heterogeneity, for example, in the form of instrumental variables
  can help us learn a systemâ€™s underlying causal structure and predict the outcome
  of unseen intervention experiments. In this paper, we consider linear models in
  which the causal effect from covariates X on a response Y is sparse. We provide
  conditions under which the causal coefficient becomes identifiable from the observed
  distribution. These conditions can be satisfied even if the number of instruments
  is as small as the number of causal parents. We also develop graphical criteria
  under which identifiability holds with probability one if the edge coefficients
  are sampled randomly from a distribution that is absolutely continuous with respect
  to Lebesgue measure and $Y$ is childless.  As an estimator, we propose spaceIV and
  prove that it consistently estimates the causal effect if the model is identifiable
  and evaluate its performance on simulated data. If identifiability does not hold,
  we show that it may still be possible to recover a subset of the causal parents.
