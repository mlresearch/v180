title: Discovery of extended summary graphs in time series
abstract: This study addresses the problem of learning an extended summary causal
  graph from time series. The algorithms we propose fit within the well-known constraint-based
  framework for causal discovery and make use of information-theoretic measures to
  determine (in)dependencies between time series. We first introduce generalizations
  of the causation entropy measure to any lagged or instantaneous relations, prior
  to using this measure to construct extended summary causal graphs by adapting two
  well-known algorithms, namely PC and FCI. The behaviour of our method is illustrated
  through several experiments.
