title: 'X-MEN: guaranteed XOR-maximum entropy constrained inverse reinforcement learning'
abstract: 'Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)  is a powerful way of learning from
  demonstrations.  In this paper, we address IRL problems with the  availability of
  prior knowledge that optimal policies  will never violate certain constraints. Conventional  approaches
  ignoring these constraints need many  demonstrations to converge. We propose XOR-Maximum
  Entropy  Constrained Inverse Reinforcement Learning (X-MEN),  which is guaranteed
  to converge to the global optimal  reward function in linear rate w.r.t. the number
  of  learning iterations. X-MEN embeds XOR-sampling –  a provable sampling approach
  which transforms  the #-P complete sampling problem into queries  to NP oracles
  – into the framework of maximum  entropy IRL. X-MEN also guarantees the learned  IRL
  agent will never generate trajectories that  violate constraints. Empirical results
  in navigation  demonstrate that X-MEN converges faster to the  optimal rewards compared
  to baseline approaches  and always generates trajectories that satisfy  multi-state
  combinatorial constraints.'
