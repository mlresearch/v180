title: Predictive Whittle networks for time series
abstract: Recent developments have shown that modeling in the spectral domain improves
  the accuracy in time series forecasting. However, state-of-the-art neural spectral
  forecasters do not generally yield trustworthy predictions. In particular, they
  lack the means to gauge predictive likelihoods and provide uncertainty estimates.
  We propose predictive Whittle networks to bridge this gap, which exploit both the
  advances of neural forecasting in the spectral domain and leverage tractable likelihoods
  of probabilistic circuits. For this purpose, we propose a novel Whittle forecasting
  loss that makes use of these predictive likelihoods to guide the training of the
  neural forecasting component. We demonstrate how predictive Whittle networks improve
  real-world forecasting accuracy, while also allowing a transformation back into
  the time domain, in order to provide the necessary feedback of when the modelâ€™s
  prediction may become erratic.
