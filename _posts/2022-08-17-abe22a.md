title: Mutation-driven follow the regularized leader for last-iterate convergence
  in zero-sum games
abstract: In this study, we consider a variant of the Follow the Regularized Leader
  (FTRL) dynamics in two-player zero-sum games. FTRL is guaranteed to converge to
  a Nash equilibrium when time-averaging the strategies, while a lot of variants suffer
  from the issue of limit cycling behavior, i.e., lack the last-iterate convergence
  guarantee. To this end, we propose mutant FTRL (M-FTRL), an algorithm that introduces
  mutation for the perturbation of action probabilities. We then investigate the continuous-time
  dynamics of M-FTRL and provide the strong convergence guarantees toward stationary
  points that approximate Nash equilibria under full-information feedback. Furthermore,
  our simulation demonstrates that M-FTRL can enjoy faster convergence rates than
  FTRL and optimistic FTRL under full-information feedback and surprisingly exhibits
  clear convergence under bandit feedback.
