title: 'Neural-progressive hedging: Enforcing constraints in reinforcement learning
  with stochastic programming'
abstract: 'We propose a framework, called neural-progressive hedging (NP), that leverages
  stochastic programming during the online phase of executing a reinforcement learning
  (RL) policy. The goal is to ensure feasibility with respect to constraints  and
  risk-based objectives such as conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) during the execution
  of the policy, using probabilistic models of the state transitions to guide policy
  adjustments. The framework is particularly amenable to the class of sequential resource
  allocation problems since feasibility with respect to typical resource constraints
  cannot be enforced in a scalable manner. The NP framework provides an alternative
  that adds modest overhead during the online phase. Experimental results demonstrate
  the efficacy of the NP framework on two continuous real-world tasks: (i) the portfolio
  optimization problem with liquidity constraints for financial planning, characterized
  by non-stationary state distributions; and (ii) the dynamic repositioning problem
  in bike sharing systems, that embodies the class of supply-demand matching problems.
  We show that the NP framework produces policies that are better than deep RL and
  other baseline approaches, adapting to non-stationarity, whilst satisfying structural
  constraints and accommodating risk measures in the resulting policies. Additional
  benefits of the NP framework are ease of implementation and  better explainability
  of the policies.'
