title: 'GNN2GNN: Graph neural networks to generate neural networks'
abstract: The success of neural networks (NNs) is tightly linked with their architectural
  design—a complex problem by itself. We here introduce a novel framework leveraging
  Graph Neural Networks to Generate Neural Networks (GNN2GNN) where powerful NN architectures
  can be learned out of a set of available architecture-performance pairs. GNN2GNN
  relies on a three-way adversarial training of GNN, to optimise a generator model
  capable of producing predictions about powerful NN architectures. Unlike Neural
  Architecture Search (NAS) techniques proposing efficient searching algorithms over
  a set of NN architec- tures, GNN2GNN relies on learning NN architectural design
  criteria. GNN2GNN learns to propose NN architectures in a single step – i.e., training
  of the generator –, overcoming the recursive approach characterising NAS. Therefore,
  GNN2GNN avoids the expensive and inflexible search of efficient structures typical
  of NAS approaches. Extensive experiments over two state-of-the-art datasets prove
  the strength of our framework, showing that it can generate powerful architectures
  with high probability. Moreover, GNN2GNN outperforms possible counterparts for generating
  NN architectures, and shows flexibility against dataset quality degradation. Finally,
  GNN2GNN paves the way towards generalisation between datasets.
