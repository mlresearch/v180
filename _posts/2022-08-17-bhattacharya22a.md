title: On testability of the front-door model via Verma constraints
abstract: The front-door criterion can be used to identify and compute causal effects
  despite the existence of unmeasured confounders between a treatment and outcome.
  However, the key assumptions – (i) the existence of a variable (or set of variables)
  that fully mediates the effect of the treatment on the outcome, and (ii) which simultaneously
  does not suffer from similar issues of confounding as the treatment-outcome pair
  – are often deemed implausible. This paper explores the testability of these assumptions.
  We show that under mild conditions involving an auxiliary variable, the assumptions
  encoded in the front-door model (and simple extensions of it) may be tested via
  generalized equality constraints a.k.a Verma constraints. We propose two goodness-of-fit
  tests based on this observation, and evaluate the efficacy of our proposal on real
  and synthetic data. We also provide theoretical and empirical comparisons to instrumental
  variable approaches to handling unmeasured confounding.
