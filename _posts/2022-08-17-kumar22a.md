title: Calibrated ensembles can mitigate accuracy tradeoffs under distribution shift
abstract: 'We often see undesirable tradeoffs in robust machine learning where out-of-distribution
  (OOD) accuracy is at odds with in-distribution (ID) accuracy. A robust classifier
  obtained via specialized techniques such as removing spurious features often has
  better OOD but worse ID accuracy compared to a standard classifier trained via vanilla
  ERM. In this paper, we find that a simple approach of ensembling the standard and
  robust models, after calibrating on only ID data, outperforms prior state-of-the-art
  both ID and OOD. On ten natural distribution shift datasets, ID-calibrated ensembles
  get the best of both worlds: strong ID accuracy of the standard model and OOD accuracy
  of the robust model. We analyze this method in stylized settings, and identify two
  important conditions for ensembles to perform well on both ID and OOD: (1) standard
  and robust models should be calibrated (on ID data, because OOD data is unavailable),
  (2) OOD has no anticorrelated spurious features.'
