title: Cycle class consistency with distributional optimal transport and knowledge
  distillation for unsupervised domain adaptation
abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a model
  trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. To this end, we
  propose in this paper a novel cycle class-consistent model based on optimal transport
  (OT) and knowledge distillation. The model consists of two agents, a teacher and
  a student cooperatively working in a cycle process under the guidance of the distributional
  optimal transport and distillation manner. The OT distance is designed to bridge
  the gap between the distribution of the target data and a distribution over the
  source class-conditional distributions. The optimal probability matrix then provides
  pseudo labels to learn a teacher that achieves a good classification performance
  on the target domain. Knowledge distillation is performed in the next step in which
  the teacher distills and transfers its knowledge to the student. And finally, the
  student produces its prediction for the optimal transport step. This process forms
  a closed cycle in which the teacher and student networks are simultaneously trained
  to conduct transfer learning from the source to the target domain. Extensive experiments
  show that our proposed method outperforms existing methods, especially the class-aware
  and OT-based ones on benchmark datasets including Office-31, Office-Home, and ImageCLEF-DA.
