title: Research on video adversarial attack with long living cycle
abstract: In recent years, the vulnerability of networks has attracted the attention
  of researchers. However, in these methods, the impact of video compression coding
  on the added adversarial perturbation, i.e., the robustness of the video adversarial
  example, is not considered. When an adversarial sample is just generated, its attack
  capability is the strongest. However, with multiple video encoding and video decoding
  in Internet transmission, the added adversarial disturbance will be continuously
  eliminated, eventually leading to the attack on the adversarial sample performance
  disappearing. We define this phenomenon as the decay of the lifetime of adversarial
  examples. We propose an adversarial attack method based on optimized integer space
  to resist this performance degradation. The robustness of anti-coding, the visual
  concealment, and the attack success rate are all considered during the attack process.
  In addition, we have also reduced the rounding loss caused by normalization in the
  deep neural network model process. The contributions of our methods are 1) We show
  the performance degradation caused by video compression coding on existing video
  adversarial attack methods, which seems an effective way for detecting of defending
  video adversarial examples. 2) A robust video adversarial attack method is proposed
  to resist video compression coding. The experiment shows that our method performs
  better on the robustness of anti-coding, visual concealment, and attack success
  rate.
