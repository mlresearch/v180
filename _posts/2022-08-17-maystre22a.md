title: Multistate analysis with infinite mixtures of Markov chains
abstract: Driven by applications in clinical medicine and business, we address the
  problem of modeling trajectories over multiple states. We build on well-known methods
  from survival analysis and introduce a family of sequence models based on localized
  Bayesian Markov chains. We develop inference and prediction algorithms, and we apply
  the model to real-world data, demonstrating favorable empirical results. Our approach
  provides a practical and effective alternative to plain Markov chains and to existing
  (finite) mixture models; It retains the simplicity and computational benefits of
  the former while matching or exceeding the predictive performance of the latter.
