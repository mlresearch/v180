title: Greedy equivalence search in the presence of latent confounders
abstract: We investigate Greedy PAG Search (GPS) for score-based causal discovery  over
  equivalence classes, similar to the famous Greedy Equivalence Search algorithm,
  except now in the presence of latent confounders. It is based on a novel characterization
  of Markov equivalence classes for MAGs, that not only improves state-of-the-art
  identification of Markov equivalence between MAGs to linear time complexity for
  sparse graphs, but also allows for efficient traversal over equivalence classes
  in the space of all MAGs. The resulting GPS algorithm is evaluated against several
  existing alternatives and found to show promising performance, both in terms of
  speed and accuracy.
