title: 'Shoring up the foundations: fusing model embeddings and weak supervision'
abstract: Foundation models offer an exciting new paradigm for constructing models
  with out-of-the-box embeddings and a few labeled examples. However, it is not clear
  how to best apply foundation models without labeled data. A potential approach is
  to fuse foundation models with weak supervision frameworks, which use weak label
  sources—pre-trained models, heuristics, crowd-workers—to construct pseudolabels.
  The challenge is building a combination that best exploits the signal available
  in both foundation models and weak sources. We propose LIGER, a combination that
  uses foundation model embeddings to improve two crucial elements of existing weak
  supervision techniques. First, we produce finer estimates of weak source quality
  by partitioning the embedding space and learning per-part source accuracies. Second,
  we improve source coverage by extending source votes in embedding space. Despite
  the black-box nature of foundation models, we prove results characterizing how our
  approach improves performance and show that lift scales with the smoothness of label
  distributions in embedding space. On six benchmark NLP and video tasks, LIGER outperforms
  vanilla weak supervision by 14.1 points, weakly-supervised kNN and adapters by 11.8
  points, and kNN and adapters supervised by traditional hand labels by 7.2 points.
