title: Combinatorial Bayesian optimization with random mapping functions to convex
  polytopes
abstract: Bayesian optimization is a popular method for solving the problem of global
  optimization of an expensive-to-evaluate black-box function. It relies on a probabilistic
  surrogate model of the objective function, upon which an acquisition function is
  built to determine where next to evaluate the objective function. In general, Bayesian
  optimization with Gaussian process regression operates on a continuous space. When
  input variables are categorical or discrete, an extra care is needed. A common approach
  is to use one-hot encoded or Boolean representation for categorical variables which
  might yield a combinatorial explosion problem. In this paper we present a method
  for Bayesian optimization in a combinatorial space, which can operate well in a
  large combinatorial space. The main idea is to use a random mapping which embeds
  the combinatorial space into a convex polytope in a continuous space, on which all
  essential process is performed to determine a solution to the black-box optimization
  in the combinatorial space. We describe our combinatorial Bayesian optimization
  algorithm and present its regret analysis. Numerical experiments demonstrate that
  our method shows satisfactory performance compared to existing methods.
