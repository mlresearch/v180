title: Fast predictive uncertainty for classification with Bayesian deep networks
abstract: 'In Bayesian Deep Learning, distributions over the output of classification
  neural networks are often approximated by first constructing a Gaussian distribution
  over the weights, then sampling from it to receive a distribution over the softmax
  outputs. This is costly. We reconsider old work (Laplace Bridge) to construct a
  Dirichlet approximation of this softmax output distribution, which yields an analytic
  map between Gaussian distributions in logit space and Dirichlet distributions (the
  conjugate prior to the Categorical distribution) in the output space.  Importantly,
  the vanilla Laplace Bridge comes with certain limitations. We analyze those and
  suggest a simple solution that compares favorably to other commonly used estimates
  of the softmax-Gaussian integral. We demonstrate that the resulting Dirichlet distribution
  has multiple advantages, in particular, more efficient computation of the uncertainty
  estimate and scaling to large datasets and networks like ImageNet and DenseNet.  We
  further demonstrate the usefulness of this Dirichlet approximation by using it to
  construct a lightweight uncertainty-aware output ranking for ImageNet. '
