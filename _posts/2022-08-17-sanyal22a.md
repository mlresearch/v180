title: How unfair is private learning?
abstract: As machine learning algorithms are deployed on sensitive data in critical
  decision making processes, it is becoming increasingly important that they are also
  private and fair. In this paper, we show that, when the data has a long-tailed structure,
  it is not possible to build accurate learning algorithms that are both private and
  results in higher accuracy on minority subpopulations. We further show that relaxing
  overall accuracy can lead to good fairness even with strict privacy requirements.
  To corroborate our theoretical results in practice, we provide an extensive set
  of experimental results using a variety of synthetic, vision (CIFAR-10 and CelebA),
  and tabular (Law School) datasets and learning algorithms.
