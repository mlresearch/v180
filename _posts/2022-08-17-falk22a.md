title: Implicit kernel meta-learning using kernel integral forms
abstract: Meta-learning algorithms have made significant progress in the context of
  meta-learning for image classification but less attention has been given to the
  regression setting. In this paper we propose to learn the probability distribution
  representing a random feature kernel that we wish to use within kernel ridge regression
  (KRR). We introduce two instances of this meta-learning framework, learning a neural
  network pushforward for a translation-invariant kernel and an affine pushforward
  for a neural network random feature kernel, both mapping from a Gaussian latent
  distribution. We learn the parameters of the pushforward by minimizing a meta-loss
  associated to the KRR objective. Since the resulting kernel does not admit an analytical
  form, we adopt a random feature sampling approach to approximate it. We call the
  resulting method Implicit Kernel Meta-Learning (IKML). We derive a meta-learning
  bound for IKML, which shows the role played by the number of tasks $T$, the task
  sample size $n$, and the number of random features $M$. In particular the bound
  implies that $M$ can be the chosen independently of $T$ and only mildly dependent
  on $n$. We introduce one synthetic and two real-world meta-learning regression benchmark
  datasets. Experiments on these datasets show that IKML
