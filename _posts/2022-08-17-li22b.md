title: 'PDQ-Net: Deep probabilistic dual quaternion network for absolute pose regression
  on $SE(3)$'
abstract: Accurate absolute pose regression is one of the key challenges in robotics
  and computer vision. Existing direct regression methods suffer from two limitations.
  First, some noisy scenarios such as poor illumination conditions are likely to result
  in the uncertainty of pose estimation. Second, the output n-dimensional feature
  vector in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ cannot be well mapped to $SE(3)$ manifold.
  In this work, we propose a deep dual quaternion network that performs the absolute
  pose regression on $SE(3)$.  We first develop an antipodally symmetric probability
  distribution over the unit dual quaternion on $SE(3)$ to model uncertainties and
  then propose an intermediary differential representation space to replace the final
  output pose, which avoids the mapping problem from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $SE(3)$. In
  addition, we introduce a backpropagation method that considers the continuousness
  and differentiability of the proposed intermediary space. Extensive experiments
  on the camera re-localization task on the Cambridge Landmarks and 7-Scenes datasets
  demonstrate that our method greatly improves the accuracy of the pose as well as
  the robustness in dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity, compared to the state-of-the-art.
