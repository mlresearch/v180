title: PAC-Bayesian domain adaptation bounds for multiclass learners
abstract: Multiclass neural networks are a common tool in modern unsupervised domain
  adaptation, yet an appropriate theoretical description for their non-uniform sample
  complexity is lacking in the adaptation literature. To fill this gap, we propose
  the first PAC-Bayesian adaptation bounds for multiclass learners. We facilitate
  practical use of our bounds by also proposing the first approximation techniques
  for the multiclass distribution divergences we consider. For divergences dependent
  on a Gibbs predictor, we propose additional PAC-Bayesian adaptation bounds which
  remove the need for inefficient Monte-Carlo estimation. Empirically, we test the
  efficacy of our proposed approximation techniques as well as some novel design-concepts
  which we include in our bounds. Finally, we apply our bounds to analyze a common
  adaptation algorithm that uses neural networks.
