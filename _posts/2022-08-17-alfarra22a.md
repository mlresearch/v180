title: Data dependent randomized smoothing
abstract: Randomized smoothing is a recent technique that achieves state-of-art performance
  in training certifiably robust deep neural networks. While the smoothing family
  of distributions is often connected to the choice of the norm used for certification,
  the parameters of these distributions are always set as global hyper parameters
  independent from the input data on which a network is certified. In this work, we
  revisit Gaussian randomized smoothing and show that the variance of the Gaussian
  distribution can be optimized at each input so as to maximize the certification
  radius for the construction of the smooth classifier. Since the data dependent classifier
  does not directly enjoy sound certification with existing approaches, we propose
  a memory-enhanced data dependent smooth classifier that is certifiable by construction.
  This new approach is generic, parameter-free, and easy to implement. In fact, we
  show that our data dependent framework can be seamlessly incorporated into 3 randomized
  smoothing approaches, leading to consistent improved certified accuracy. When this
  framework is used in the training routine of these approaches followed by a data
  dependent certification, we achieve 9% and 6% improvement over the certified accuracy
  of the strongest baseline for a radius of 0.5 on CIFAR10 and ImageNet.
