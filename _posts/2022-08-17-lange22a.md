title: Interpolating between sampling and variational inference with infinite stochastic
  mixtures
abstract: 'Sampling and Variational Inference (VI) are two large families of methods
  for approximate inference that have complementary strengths. Sampling methods excel
  at approximating arbitrary probability distributions, but can be inefficient. VI
  methods are efficient, but may misrepresent the true distribution. Here, we develop
  a general framework where approximations are stochastic mixtures of simple component
  distributions. Both sampling and VI can be seen as special cases: in sampling, each
  mixture component is a delta-function and is chosen stochastically, while in standard
  VI a single component is chosen to minimize divergence. We derive a practical method
  that interpolates between sampling and VI by analytically solving an optimization
  problem over a mixing distribution. Intermediate inference methods then arise by
  varying a single parameter. Our method provably improves on sampling (reducing variance)
  and on VI (reducing bias+variance despite increasing variance). We demonstrate our
  methodâ€™s bias/variance trade-off in practice on reference problems, and we compare
  outcomes to commonly used sampling and VI methods. This work takes a step towards
  a highly flexible yet simple family of inference methods that combines the complementary
  strengths of sampling and VI.'
