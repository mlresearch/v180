title: Robust learning of tractable probabilistic models
abstract: Tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) compactly represent a joint probability
  distribution over a large number of random variables and admit polynomial  time
  computation of (1) exact likelihoods; (2) marginal probability distributions over
  a small subset of variables given evidence; and (3) in some cases most probable
  explanations over all non-observed variables given observations. In this paper,
  we leverage these tractability properties to solve the robust maximum likelihood
  parameter estimation task in TPMs under the assumption that a TPM structure and
  complete training data is provided as input. Specifically, we show that TPMs learned
  by optimizing the likelihood perform poorly when data is subject to adversarial
  attacks/noise/perturbations/corruption and we can address this issue by optimizing
  robust likelihood. To this end, we develop an efficient approach for constructing
  uncertainty sets that model data corruption in TPMs and derive an efficient gradient-based
  local search method for learning TPMs that are robust against these uncertainty
  sets. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach on a collection
  of benchmark datasets.
