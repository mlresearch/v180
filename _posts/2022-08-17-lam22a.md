title: Greedy relaxations of the sparsest permutation algorithm
abstract: There has been an increasing interest in methods that exploit permutation
  reasoning to search for directed acyclic causal models, including the “Ordering
  Search’’ of Teyssier and Kohler and GSP of Solus, Wang and Uhler. We extend the
  methods of the latter by a permutation-based operation tuck, and develop a class
  of algorithms, namely GRaSP, that are computationally efficient and pointwise consistent
  under increasingly weaker assumptions than faithfulness. The most relaxed form of
  GRaSP outperforms many state-of-the-art causal search algorithms in simulation,
  allowing efficient and accurate search even for dense graphs and graphs with more
  than 100 variables.
