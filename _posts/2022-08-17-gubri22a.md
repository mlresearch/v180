title: Efficient and transferable adversarial examples from bayesian neural networks
abstract: An established way to improve the transferability of black-box evasion attacks
  is to craft the adversarial examples on an ensemble-based surrogate to increase
  diversity. We argue that transferability is fundamentally related to uncertainty.
  Based on a state-of-the-art Bayesian Deep Learning technique, we propose a new method
  to efficiently build a surrogate by sampling approximately from the posterior distribution
  of neural network weights, which represents the belief about the value of each parameter.
  Our extensive experiments on ImageNet, CIFAR-10 and MNIST show that our approach
  improves the success rates of four state-of-the-art attacks significantly (up to
  83.2 percentage points), in both intra-architecture and inter-architecture transferability.
  On ImageNet, our approach can reach 94% of success rate while reducing training
  computations from 11.6 to 2.4 exaflops, compared to an ensemble of independently
  trained DNNs. Our vanilla surrogate achieves 87.5% of the time higher transferability
  than three test-time techniques designed for this purpose. Our work demonstrates
  that the way to train a surrogate has been overlooked, although it is an important
  element of transfer-based attacks. We are, therefore, the first to review the effectiveness
  of several training methods in increasing transferability. We provide new directions
  to better understand the transferability phenomenon and offer a simple but strong
  baseline for future work.
