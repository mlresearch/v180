title: Bayesian quantile and expectile optimisation
abstract: Bayesian optimisation (BO) is widely used  to optimise stochastic black
  box functions. While most BO approaches focus on optimising conditional expectations,
  many applications require risk-averse strategies and alternative criteria accounting
  for the distribution tails need to be considered. In this paper, we propose new
  variational models for Bayesian quantile and expectile regression that are well-suited
  for heteroscedastic noise settings. Our models consist of two latent Gaussian processes
  accounting respectively for the conditional quantile (or expectile) and the scale
  parameter of an asymmetric likelihood functions. Furthermore, we propose two BO
  strategies based on max-value entropy search and Thompson sampling, that are tailored
  to such models and that can accommodate large batches of points. Contrary to existing
  BO approaches for risk-averse optimisation, our strategies can directly optimise
  for the quantile and expectile, without requiring replicating observations or assuming
  a parametric form for the noise. As illustrated in the experimental section, the
  proposed approach clearly outperforms the state of the art in the heteroscedastic,
  non-Gaussian case.
