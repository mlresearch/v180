title: Neuro-symbolic entropy regularization
abstract: In structured output prediction, the goal is to jointly predict several
  output variables that together encode a structured object – a path in a graph, an
  entity-relation triple, or an ordering of objects. Such a large output space makes
  learning hard and requires vast amounts of labeled data. Different approaches leverage
  alternate sources of supervision. One approach – entropy regularization – posits
  that decision boundaries should lie in low-probability regions. It extracts supervision
  from unlabeled examples, but remains agnostic to the structure of the output space.
  Conversely, neuro-symbolic approaches exploit the knowledge that not every prediction
  corresponds to a valid structure in the output space. Yet, they do not further restrict
  the learned output distribution.This paper introduces a framework that unifies both
  approaches. We propose a loss, neuro-symbolic entropy regularization, that encourages
  the model to confidently predict a valid object. It is obtained by restricting entropy
  regularization to the distribution over only the valid structures. This loss can
  be computed efficiently when the output constraint is expressed as a tractable logic
  circuit. Moreover, it seamlessly integrates with other neuro-symbolic losses that
  eliminate invalid predictions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a
  series of semi-supervised and fully-supervised structured-prediction experiments,
  where it leads to models whose predictions are more accurate as well as more likely
  to be valid.
