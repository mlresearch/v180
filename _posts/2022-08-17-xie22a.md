title: Fine-Grained matching with multi-perspective similarity modeling for cross-modal
  retrieval
abstract: Cross-modal retrieval relies on learning inter-modal correspondences. Most
  existing approaches focus on learning global or local correspondence and fail to
  explore fine-grained multi-level alignments. Moreover, it remains to be investigated
  how to infer more accurate similarity scores. In this paper, we propose a novel
  fine-grained matching with Multi-Perspective Similarity Modeling (MPSM) Network
  for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, the Knowledge Graph Iterative Dissemination
  (KGID) module is designed to iteratively broadcast global semantic knowledge, enabling
  domain information to be integrated and relevant nodes to be associated, resulting
  in fine-grained modality representations. Subsequently, vector-based similarity
  representations are learned from multiple perspectives to model multi-level alignments
  comprehensively. The Relation Graph Reconstruction (SRGR) module is further developed
  to enhance cross-modal correspondence by constructing similarity relation graphs
  and adaptively reconstructing them. Extensive experiments on the Flickr30K and MSCOCO
  datasets validate that our model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art
  baselines.
