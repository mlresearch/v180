title: Principle of relevant information for graph sparsification
abstract: Graph sparsification aims to reduce the number of edges of a graph while
  maintaining its structural properties. In this paper, we propose the first general
  and effective information-theoretic formulation of graph sparsification, by taking
  inspiration from the Principle of Relevant Information (PRI). To this end, we extend
  the PRI from a standard scalar random variable setting to structured data (i.e.,
  graphs). Our Graph-PRI objective is achieved by operating on the graph Laplacian,
  made possible by expressing the graph Laplacian of a subgraph in terms of a sparse
  edge selection vector w. We provide both theoretical and empirical justifications
  on the validity of our Graph-PRI approach. We also analyze its analytical solutions
  in a few special cases. We finally present three representative real-world applications,
  namely graph sparsification, graph regularized multi-task learning, and medical
  imaging-derived brain network classification, to demonstrate the effectiveness,
  the versatility and the enhanced interpretability of our approach over prevalent
  sparsification techniques. Code of Graph-PRI is available at https://github.com/SJYuCNEL/PRI-Graphs.
