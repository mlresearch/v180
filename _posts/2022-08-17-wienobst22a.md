title: A new constructive criterion for Markov equivalence of MAGs
abstract: Ancestral graphs are an important tool for encoding causal knowledge as
  they represent uncertainty about the presence of latent confounding and selection
  bias, and they can be inferred from data. As for other graphical models, several
  maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) may encode the same statistical information in the
  form of conditional independencies.  Such MAGs are said to be Markov equivalent.
  This work concerns graphical characterizations and computational aspects of Markov
  equivalence between MAGs. These issues have been studied in past years leading to
  several criteria and methods to test Markov equivalence. The state-of-the-art algorithm,
  provided by Hu and Evans [UAI 2020], runs in time $O(n^5)$ for instances with $n$
  vertices. We propose a new constructive graphical criterion for the Markov equivalence
  of MAGs, which allows us to develop a practically effective equivalence test with
  worst-case runtime $O(n^3)$. Additionally, our criterion is expressed in terms of
  natural graphical concepts, which is of independent value.
