title: Semiparametric causal sufficient dimension reduction of multidimensional treatments
abstract: Cause-effect relationships are typically evaluated by comparing outcome
  responses to binary treatment values, representing two arms of a hypothetical randomized
  controlled trial. However, in certain applications, treatments of interest are continuous
  and multidimensional. For example, understanding the causal relationship between
  severity of radiation therapy, summarized by a multidimensional vector of radiation
  exposure values and post-treatment side effects is a problem of clinical interest
  in radiation oncology. An appropriate strategy for making interpretable causal conclusions
  is to reduce the dimension of treatment. If individual elements of a multidimensional
  treatment vector weakly affect the outcome, but the overall relationship between
  treatment and outcome is strong, careless approaches to dimension reduction may
  not preserve this relationship. Further, methods developed for regression problems
  do not directly transfer to causal inference due to confounding complications. In
  this paper, we use semiparametric inference theory for structural models to give
  a general approach to causal sufficient dimension reduction of a multidimensional
  treatment such that the cause-effect relationship between treatment and outcome
  is preserved. We illustrate the utility of our proposals through simulations and
  a real data application in radiation oncology.
