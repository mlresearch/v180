title: Learning soft interventions in complex equilibrium systems
abstract: Complex systems often contain feedback loops that can be described as cyclic
  causal models. Intervening in such systems may lead to counterintuitive effects,
  which cannot be inferred directly from the graph structure. After establishing a
  framework for differentiable soft interventions based on Lie groups, we take advantage
  of modern automatic differentiation techniques and their application to implicit
  functions in order to optimize interventions in cyclic causal models. We illustrate
  the use of this framework by investigating scenarios of transition to sustainable
  economies.
