title: Linearizing contextual bandits with latent state dynamics
abstract: In many real-world applications of multi-armed bandit problems, both rewards
  and contexts are often influenced by confounding latent variables which evolve stochastically
  over time. While the observed contexts and rewards are nonlinearly related, we show
  that prior knowledge of latent causal structure can be used to reduce the problem
  to the linear bandit setting. We develop two algorithms, Latent Linear Thompson
  Sampling (L2TS) and Latent Linear UCB (L2UCB), which use online EM algorithms for
  hidden Markov models to learn the latent transition model and maintain a posterior
  belief over the latent state, and then use the resulting posteriors as context features
  in a linear bandit problem. We upper bound the error in reward estimation in the
  presence of a dynamical latent state, and derive a novel problem-dependent regret
  bound for linear Thompson sampling with non-stationarity and unconstrained reward
  distributions, which we apply to L2TS under certain conditions. Finally, we demonstrate
  the superiority of our algorithms over related bandit algorithms through experiments.
