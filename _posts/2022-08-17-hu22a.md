title: Near-optimal Thompson sampling-based algorithms for differentially private
  stochastic bandits
abstract: 'We address differentially private stochastic bandits. We present two (near)-optimal  Thompson
  Sampling-based learning algorithms: DP-TS and Lazy-DP-TS. The core idea in achieving
  optimality  is  the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. We reshape
  the posterior distribution in an optimistic way as compared to the  non-private
  Thompson Sampling. Our DP-TS achieves a $\sum\limits_{j \in \mathcal{A}: \Delta_j
  > 0} O \left(\frac{\log(T)}{\min \left\{\epsilon, \Delta_j \right\} )} \log \left(\frac{\log(T)}{\epsilon
  \cdot \Delta_j} \right) \right)$ regret bound, where $\mathcal{A}$ is the arm set,
  $\Delta_j$ is the sub-optimality gap of a sub-optimal arm $j$, and $\epsilon$ is
  the  privacy parameter.  Our Lazy-DP-TS gets rid of the extra $\log$ factor by using
  the idea of dropping observations. The regret of Lazy-DP-TS  is  $ \sum\limits_{j
  \in \mathcal{A}: \Delta_j > 0} O \left(\frac{\log(T)}{\min \left\{\epsilon, \Delta_j
  \right\}} \right)$, which matches the  regret lower bound. Additionally, we conduct
  experiments to compare the empirical performance of our proposed  algorithms with
  the existing optimal  algorithms for differentially private stochastic bandits.'
