title: Using hierarchies to efficiently combine evidence with Dempster’s rule of combination
abstract: 'Dempster’s rule of combination allows us to combine various independent
  pieces of evidence that each have a certain degree of uncertainty. This provides
  a useful way for dealing with uncertain evidence, but the rule is computationally
  intractable. In this paper, we analyze the complexity of this rule for differently
  structured bodies of evidence and we consider a known algorithm by Shafer and Logan
  to compute this rule efficiently over a hierarchical set of evidence. We show that
  one can check in polynomial time whether an arbitrary set of evidence has a hierarchical
  shape, enabling the use of Shafer and Logan’s algorithm. Moreover, we consider two
  different approaches to deal with non-hierarchical sets of evidence: (i) considering
  hierarchical subsets and (ii) taking advantage of internal hierarchical structures
  in the overall set. For the former case, we conclude that getting different hierarchies
  from an arbitrary set of pieces of evidence corresponds to the VERTEX COVER problem
  and we present algorithms for obtaining these hierarchies based on this correspondence.
  For the latter case, we present a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm which computes
  the belief function of any piece of evidence included in the set.'
