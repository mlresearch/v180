title: Finite-horizon equilibria for neuro-symbolic concurrent stochastic games
abstract: 'We present novel techniques for neuro-symbolic concurrent stochastic games,
  a recently proposed modelling formalism to represent a set of probabilistic agents
  operating in a continuous-space environment using a combination of neural network
  based perception mechanisms and traditional symbolic methods. To date, only zero-sum
  variants of the model were studied, which is too restrictive when agents have distinct
  objectives. We formalise notions of equilibria for these models and present algorithms
  to synthesise them. Focusing on the finite-horizon setting, and (global) social
  welfare subgame-perfect optimality, we consider two distinct types: Nash equilibria
  and correlated equilibria. We first show that an exact solution based on backward
  induction may yield arbitrarily bad equilibria. We then propose an approximation
  algorithm called frozen subgame improvement, which proceeds through iterative solution
  of nonlinear programs. We develop a prototype implementation and demonstrate the
  benefits of our approach on two case studies: an automated car-parking system and
  an aircraft collision avoidance system.'
