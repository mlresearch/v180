title: A mutually exciting latent space Hawkes process model for continuous-time networks
abstract: Networks and temporal point processes serve as fundamental building blocks
  for modeling complex dynamic relational data in various domains. We propose the
  latent space Hawkes (LSH) model, a novel generative model for continuous-time networks
  of relational events, using a latent space representation for nodes. We model relational
  events between nodes using mutually exciting Hawkes processes with baseline intensities
  dependent upon the distances between the nodes in the latent space and sender and
  receiver specific effects. We demonstrate that our proposed LSH model can replicate
  many features observed in real temporal networks including reciprocity and transitivity,
  while also achieving superior prediction accuracy and providing more interpretable
  fits than existing models.
