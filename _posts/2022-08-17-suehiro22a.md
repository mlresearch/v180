title: Simplified and unified analysis of various learning problems by reduction to
  Multiple-Instance Learning
abstract: In statistical learning, many problem formulations have been proposed so
  far, such as multi-class learning, complementarily labeled learning, multi-label
  learning, multi-task learning, which provide theoretical models for various real-world
  tasks. Although they have been extensively studied, the relationship among them
  has not been fully investigated. In this work, we focus on a particular problem
  formulation called Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL), and show that various learning
  problems including all the problems mentioned above with some of new problems can
  be reduced to MIL with theoretically guaranteed generalization bounds, where the
  reductions are established under a new reduction scheme we provide as a by-product.
  The results imply that the MIL-reduction gives a simplified and unified framework
  for designing and analyzing algorithms for various learning problems. Moreover,
  we show that the MIL-reduction framework can be kernelized.
