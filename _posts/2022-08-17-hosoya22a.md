title: 'CIGMO: Categorical invariant representations in a deep generative framework'
abstract: 'Data of general object images have two most common structures: (1) each
  object of a given shape can be rendered in multiple different views, and (2) shapes
  of objects can be categorized in such a way that the diversity of shapes is much
  larger across categories than within a category.  Existing deep generative models
  can typically capture either structure, but not both.  In this work, we introduce
  a novel deep generative model, called CIGMO, that can learn to represent category,
  shape, and view factors from image data.  The model is comprised of multiple modules
  of shape representations that are each specialized to a particular category and
  disentangled from view representation, and can be learned using a group-based weakly
  supervised learning method.  By empirical investigation, we show that our model
  can effectively discover categories of object shapes despite large view variation
  and quantitatively supersede various previous methods including the state-of-the-art
  invariant clustering algorithm.  Further, we show that our approach using category-specialization
  can enhance the learned shape representation to better perform down-stream tasks
  such as one-shot object identification as well as shape-view disentanglement.'
