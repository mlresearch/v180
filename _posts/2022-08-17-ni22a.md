title: Ordinal causal discovery
abstract: Causal discovery for purely observational, categorical data is a long-standing
  challenging problem. Unlike continuous data, the vast majority of existing methods
  for categorical data focus on inferring the Markov equivalence class only, which
  leaves the direction of some causal relationships undetermined. This paper proposes
  an identifiable ordinal causal discovery method that exploits the ordinal information
  contained in many real-world applications to uniquely identify the causal structure.
  The proposed method is applicable beyond ordinal data via data discretization. Through
  real-world and synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed ordinal causal
  discovery method combined with simple score-and-search algorithms has favorable
  and robust performance compared to state-of-the-art alternative methods in both
  ordinal categorical and non-categorical data. An accompanied R package OCD is freely
  available at the first authorâ€™s website.
