title: Addressing token uniformity in transformers via singular value transformation
abstract: Token uniformity is commonly observed in transformer-based models, in which
  different tokens share a large proportion of similar information after going through
  stacked multiple self-attention layers in a transformer. In this paper, we propose
  to use the distribution of singular values of outputs of each transformer layer
  to characterise the phenomenon of token uniformity and empirically illustrate that
  a less skewed singular value distribution can alleviate the token uniformity problem.
  Base on our observations, we define several desirable properties of singular value
  distributions and propose a novel transformation function for updating the singular
  values. We show that apart from alleviating token uniformity, the transformation
  function should preserve the local neighbourhood structure in the original embedding
  space. Our proposed singular value transformation function is applied to a range
  of transformer-based language models such as BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa and DistilBERT,
  and improved performance is observed in semantic textual similarity evaluation and
  a range of GLUE tasks.
