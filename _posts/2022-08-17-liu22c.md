title: 'SASH: Efficient secure aggregation based on SHPRG for federated learning'
abstract: To prevent private training data leakage in Federated Learning systems,
  we propose a novel secure aggregation scheme based on seed homomorphic pseudo-random
  generator (SHPRG), named SASH. SASH leverages the homomorphic property of SHPRG
  to simplify the masking and demasking scheme, which for each of the clients and
  for the server, entails a overhead linear w.r.t model size and constant w.r.t number
  of clients. We prove that even against worst-case colluding adversaries, SASH preserves
  training data privacy, while being resilient to dropouts without extra overhead.
  We experimentally demonstrate SASH significantly improves the efficiency to 20Ã—
  over baseline, especially in the more realistic case where the numbers of clients
  and model size become large, and a certain percentage of clients drop out from the
  system.
