title: SMT-based weighted model integration with structure awareness
abstract: Weighted Model Integration (WMI) is a popular formalism aimed at unifying
  approaches for probabilistic inference in hybrid domains, involving logical and
  algebraic constraints. Despite a considerable amount of recent work, allowing WMI
  algorithms to scale with the complexity of the hybrid problem is still a challenge.
  In this paper we highlight some substantial limitations of existing state-of-the-art
  solutions, and develop an algorithm that combines SMT-based enumeration, an efficient
  technique in formal verification, with an effective encoding of the problem structure.  This
  allows our algorithm to avoid generating redundant models, resulting in substantial
  computational savings. An extensive experimental evaluation on both synthetic and
  real-world datasets confirms the advantage of the proposed solution over existing
  alternatives.
