title: A causal bandit approach to learning good atomic interventions in presence
  of unobserved confounders
abstract: We study the problem of determining the best atomic intervention in a Causal
  Bayesian Network (CBN) specified only by its causal graph. We model this as a stochastic
  multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with side-information, where interventions on CBN
  correspond to arms of the bandit instance. First, we propose a simple regret minimization
  algorithm that takes as input a causal graph with observable and unobservable nodes
  and in $T$ exploration rounds achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{m(\mathcal{C})/T})$ expected
  simple regret. Here $m(\mathcal{C})$ is a parameter dependent on the input CBN $\mathcal{C}$
  and could be much smaller than the number of arms. We also show that this is almost
  optimal for CBNs whose causal graphs have an $n$-ary tree structure.  Next, we propose
  a cumulative regret minimization algorithm that takes as input a causal graph with
  observable nodes and performs better than the optimal MAB algorithms that do not
  use causal side-information. We experimentally compare both our algorithms with
  the best known algorithms in the literature.
