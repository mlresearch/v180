title: Nonparametric exponential family graph embeddings for multiple representation
  learning
abstract: In graph data, each node often serves multiple functionalities. However,
  most graph embedding models assume that each node can only possess one representation.
  We address this issue by proposing a nonparametric graph embedding model. The model
  allows each node to learn multiple representations where they are needed to represent
  the complexity of random walks in the graph. It extends the Exponential family graph
  embedding model with two nonparametric prior settings, the Dirichlet process and
  the uniform process. The model combines the ability of Exponential family graph
  embedding to take the number of occurrences of context nodes into account with nonparametric
  priors giving it the flexibility to learn more than one latent representation for
  each node. The learned embeddings outperform other state of the art approaches in
  link prediction and node classification tasks.
