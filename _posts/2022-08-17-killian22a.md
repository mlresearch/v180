title: 'Restless and uncertain: Robust policies for restless bandits via deep multi-agent
  reinforcement learning'
abstract: We introduce robustness in \textit{restless multi-armed bandits} (RMABs),
  a popular model for constrained resource allocation among independent stochastic
  processes (arms). Nearly all RMAB techniques assume stochastic dynamics are precisely
  known. However, in many real-world settings, dynamics are estimated with significant
  uncertainty, e.g., via historical data, which can lead to bad outcomes if ignored.
  To address this, we develop an algorithm to compute minimax regret–robust policies
  for RMABs. Our approach uses a double oracle framework (oracles for \textit{agent}
  and \textit{nature}), which is often used for single-process robust planning but
  requires significant new techniques to accommodate the combinatorial nature of RMABs.
  Specifically, we design a deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, DDLPO, which
  tackles the combinatorial challenge by learning an auxiliary “$\lambda$-network”
  in tandem with policy networks per arm, greatly reducing sample complexity, with
  guarantees on convergence. DDLPO, of general interest, implements our reward-maximizing
  agent oracle. We then tackle the challenging regret-maximizing nature oracle, a
  non-stationary RL challenge, by formulating it as a multi-agent RL problem between
  a policy optimizer and adversarial nature. This formulation is of general interest—we
  solve it for RMABs by creating a multi-agent extension of DDLPO with a shared critic.
  We show our approaches work well in three experimental domains.
