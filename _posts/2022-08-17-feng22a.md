title: Sequential algorithmic modification with test data reuse
abstract: " After initial release of a machine learning algorithm, the model can be
  fine-tuned by retraining on subsequently gathered data, adding newly discovered
  features, or more. Each modification introduces a risk of deteriorating performance
  and must be validated on a test dataset. It may not always be practical to assemble
  a new dataset for testing each modification, especially when most modifications
  are minor or are implemented in rapid succession. Recent work has shown how one
  can repeatedly test modifications on the same dataset and protect against overfitting
  by (i) discretizing test results along a grid and (ii) applying a Bonferroni correction
  to adjust for the total number of modifications considered by an adaptive developer.
  However, the standard Bonferroni correction is overly conservative when most modifications
  are beneficial and/or highly correlated. This work investigates more powerful approaches
  using alpha-recycling and sequentially-rejective graphical procedures (SRGPs). We
  introduce two novel extensions that account for correlation between adaptively chosen
  algorithmic modifications: the first leverages the correlation between consecutive
  modifications using flexible fixed sequence tests, and the second leverages the
  correlation between the proposed modifications and those generated by a hypothetical
  prespecified model updating procedure. In empirical analyses, both SRGPs control
  the error rate of approving deleterious modifications and approve significantly
  more beneficial modifications than previous approaches."
