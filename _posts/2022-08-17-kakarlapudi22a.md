title: Decision-theoretic planning with communication in open multiagent systems
abstract: In open multiagent systems, the set of agents operating in the environment
  changes over time and in ways that are nontrivial to predict. For example, if collaborative
  robots were tasked with fighting wildfires, they may run out of suppressants and
  be temporarily unavailable to assist their peers. Because an agent’s optimal action
  depends on the actions of others, each agent must not only predict the actions of
  its peers, but, before that, reason whether they are even present to perform an
  action.  Addressing openness thus requires agents to model each other’s presence,
  which can be enhanced through agents communicating about their presence in the environment.  At
  the same time, communicative acts can also incur costs (e.g., consuming limited
  bandwidth), and thus an agent must tradeoff the benefits of enhanced coordination
  with the costs of communication.  We present a new principled, decision-theoretic
  method in the context provided by the recent communicative interactive POMDP framework
  for planning in open agent settings that balances this tradeoff. Simulations of
  multiagent wildfire suppression problems demonstrate how communication can improve
  planning in open agent environments, as well as how agents tradeoff the benefits
  and costs of communication under different scenarios.
