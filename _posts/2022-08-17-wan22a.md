title: Bias aware probabilistic Boolean matrix factorization
abstract: 'Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) is a combinatorial problem arising from
  a wide range of applications including recommendation system, collaborative filtering,
  and dimensionality reduction. Currently, the noise model of existing BMF methods
  is often assumed to be homoscedastic; however, in real world data scenarios, the
  deviations of observed data from their true values are almost surely diverse due
  to stochastic noises, making  each data point not equally suitable for fitting a
  model. In this case, it is not ideal to treat all data points as equally distributed.
  Motivated by such observations, we introduce a probabilistic BMF model that recognizes
  the object- and feature-wise bias distribution respectively, called bias aware BMF
  (BABF). To the best of our knowledge, BABF is the first approach for Boolean decomposition
  with consideration of the feature-wise and object-wise bias in binary data. We conducted
  experiments on datasets with different levels of background noise, bias level, and
  sizes of the signal patterns, to test the effectiveness of our method in various
  scenarios. We demonstrated that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art factorization
  methods in both accuracy and efficiency in recovering the original datasets, and
  the inferred bias level is highly  significantly correlated with true existing bias
  in both simulated and real world datasets. '
