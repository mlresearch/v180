title: Towards unsupervised open world semantic segmentation
abstract: 'For the semantic segmentation of images, state-of-the-art deep neural networks
  (DNNs) achieve high segmentation accuracy if that task is restricted to a closed
  set of classes. However, as of now DNNs have limited ability to operate in an open
  world, where they are tasked to identify pixels belonging to unknown objects and
  eventually to learn novel classes, incrementally. Humans have the capability to
  say: “I don’t know what that is, but I’ve already seen something like that”. Therefore,
  it is desirable to perform such an incremental learning task in an unsupervised
  fashion. We introduce a method where unknown objects are clustered based on visual
  similarity. Those clusters are utilized to define new classes and serve as training
  data for unsupervised incremental learning. More precisely, the connected components
  of a predicted semantic segmentation are assessed by a segmentation quality estimate.
  Connected components with a low estimated prediction quality are candidates for
  a subsequent clustering. Additionally, the component-wise quality assessment allows
  for obtaining predicted segmentation masks for the image regions potentially containing
  unknown objects. The respective pixels of such masks are pseudo-labeled and afterwards
  used for re-training the DNN, i.e., without the use of ground truth generated by
  humans. In our experiments we demonstrate that, without access to ground truth and
  even with few data, a DNN’s class space can be extended by a novel class, achieving
  considerable segmentation accuracy.'
