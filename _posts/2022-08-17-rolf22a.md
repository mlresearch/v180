title: Resolving label uncertainty with implicit posterior models
abstract: 'We propose a method for jointly inferring labels across a collection of
  data samples, where each sample consists of an observation and a prior belief about
  the label. By implicitly assuming the existence of a generative model for which
  a differentiable predictor is the posterior, we derive a training objective that
  allows learning under weak beliefs. This formulation unifies various machine learning
  settings; the weak beliefs can come in the form of noisy or incomplete labels, likelihoods
  given by a different prediction mechanism on auxiliary input, or common-sense priors
  reflecting knowledge about the structure of the problem at hand. We demonstrate
  the proposed algorithms on diverse problems: classification with negative training
  examples, learning from rankings, weakly and self-supervised aerial imagery segmentation,
  co-segmentation of video frames, and coarsely supervised text classification.'
