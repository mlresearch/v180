title: Offline change detection under contamination
abstract: In this work, we propose a non-parametric and robust change detection algorithm
  to detect multiple change points in time series data under non-adversarial contamination.
  The algorithm is designed for the offline setting, where the objective is to detect
  changes when all data are received. We only make weak moment assumptions on the
  inliers (uncorrupted data) to handle a large class of distributions. The robust
  scan statistic in the change detection algorithm is fashioned using mean estimators
  based on influence functions. We establish the consistency of the estimated change
  point indexes as the number of samples increases, and provide empirical evidence
  to support the consistency results.
