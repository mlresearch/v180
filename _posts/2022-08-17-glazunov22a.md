title: Do Bayesian variational autoencoders know what they don’t know?
abstract: 'The problem of detecting the Out-of-Distribution (OoD) inputs is of paramount
  importance for Deep Neural Networks. It has been previously shown that even Deep
  Generative Models that allow estimating the density of the inputs may not be reliable
  and often tend to make over-confident predictions for OoDs, assigning to them a
  higher density than to the in-distribution data. This over-confidence in a single
  model can be potentially mitigated with Bayesian inference over the model parameters
  that take into account epistemic uncertainty. This paper investigates three approaches
  to Bayesian inference: stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo, Bayes by Backpropagation,
  and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian. The inference is implemented over the
  weights of the deep neural networks that parameterize the likelihood of the Variational
  Autoencoder. We empirically evaluate the approaches against several benchmarks that
  are often used for OoD detection: estimation of the marginal likelihood utilizing
  sampled model ensemble, typicality test, disagreement score, and Watanabe-Akaike
  Information Criterion. Finally, we introduce two simple scores that demonstrate
  the state-of-the-art performance.'
