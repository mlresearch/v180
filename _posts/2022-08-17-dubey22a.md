title: Improving sign-random-projection via count sketch
abstract: 'Computing the angular similarity between pairs of vectors is a core part
  of various machine learning algorithms. The seminal work of Charikar (a.k.a. Sign-Random-Projection
  (SRP) or SimHash) provides an unbiased estimate for the same. However, SRP suffers
  from the following limitations: (i) large variance in the similarity estimation,
  (ii) and high running time while computing the sketch. There are improved variants
  that address these limitations. However, they are known to improve on only one aspect
  in their proposal, for e.g. Yu et al. suggest a faster algorithm, Ji et al., Kang
  and Wong, provide estimates with a smaller variance. In this work, we propose a
  sketching algorithm that addresses both aspects in one algorithm â€“ a faster algorithm
  along with a smaller variance in the similarity estimation. Moreover, our algorithm
  is space-efficient as well. We present a rigorous theoretical analysis of our proposal
  and complement it via experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. '
