title: 'Deterministic policy gradient: Convergence analysis'
abstract: The deterministic policy gradient (DPG) method proposed in Silver et al.
  [2014] has been demonstrated to exhibit superior performance particularly for applications
  with multi-dimensional and continuous action spaces. However, it remains unclear
  whether DPG converges, and if so, how fast it converges and whether it converges
  as efficiently as other PG methods. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis
  of DPG to answer those questions. We study the single timescale DPG (often the case
  in practice) in both on-policy and off-policy settings, and show that both algorithms
  attain an $\epsilon$-accurate stationary policy with a sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$.
  Moreover, we establish the convergence rate for DPG under Gaussian noise exploration,
  which is widely adopted in practice to improve the performance of DPG. To our best
  knowledge, this is the first non-asymptotic convergence characterization for DPG
  methods.
