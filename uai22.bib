    abstract = {In this study, we consider a variant of the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) dynamics in two-player zero-sum games. FTRL is guaranteed to converge to a Nash equilibrium when time-averaging the strategies, while a lot of variants suffer from the issue of limit cycling behavior, i.e., lack the last-iterate convergence guarantee. To this end, we propose mutant FTRL (M-FTRL), an algorithm that introduces mutation for the perturbation of action probabilities. We then investigate the continuous-time dynamics of M-FTRL and provide the strong convergence guarantees toward stationary points that approximate Nash equilibria under full-information feedback. Furthermore, our simulation demonstrates that M-FTRL can enjoy faster convergence rates than FTRL and optimistic FTRL under full-information feedback and surprisingly exhibits clear convergence under bandit feedback.},

    abstract = {A major limiting factor in graphical model inference is the complexity of computing the partition function. Exact message-passing algorithms such as Bucket Elimination (BE) require exponential memory to compute the partition function; therefore, approximations are necessary. In this paper, we build upon a recently introduced methodology called Deep Bucket Elimination (DBE) that uses classical Neural Networks to approximate messages generated by BE for large buckets. The main feature of our new scheme, renamed NeuroBE, is that it customizes the architecture of the neural networks, their learning process and in particular, adapts the loss function to the internal form or distribution of messages. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and time compared with the earlier DBE scheme.},

At every interaction, the agent obtains a reward and incurs $K$ costs. The agent aims to maximize the long-term average reward while simultaneously keeping the $K$ long-term average costs lower than a certain threshold. In this paper, we propose \NAM, a posterior sampling based algorithm using which the agent can learn optimal policies to interact with the CMDP. We show that with the assumption of slackness, characterized by $\kappa$, the optimization problem is feasible for the sampled MDPs. Further, for MDP with $S$ states, $A$ actions, and mixing time $T_M$, we prove that following \NAM\ algorithm, the agent can bound the regret of not accumulating rewards from an optimal policy by $\Tilde{O}(T_MS\sqrt{AT})$. Further, we show that the violations for any of the $K$ constraints is also bounded by $\Tilde{O}(T_MS\sqrt{AT})$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that obtains a $\Tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bounds for ergodic MDPs with long-term average constraints using a posterior sampling method.},

    abstract = {The success of neural networks (NNs) is tightly linked with their architectural design—a complex problem by itself. We here introduce a novel framework leveraging Graph Neural Networks to Generate Neural Networks (GNN2GNN) where powerful NN architectures can be learned out of a set of available architecture-performance pairs. GNN2GNN relies on a three-way adversarial training of GNN, to optimise a generator model capable of producing predictions about powerful NN architectures. Unlike Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques proposing efficient searching algorithms over a set of NN architec- tures, GNN2GNN relies on learning NN architectural design criteria. GNN2GNN learns to propose NN architectures in a single step – i.e., training of the generator –, overcoming the recursive approach characterising NAS. Therefore, GNN2GNN avoids the expensive and inflexible search of efficient structures typical of NAS approaches. Extensive experiments over two state-of-the-art datasets prove the strength of our framework, showing that it can generate powerful architectures with high probability. Moreover, GNN2GNN outperforms possible counterparts for generating NN architectures, and shows flexibility against dataset quality degradation. Finally, GNN2GNN paves the way towards generalisation between datasets.},

    abstract = {In structured output prediction, the goal is to jointly predict several output variables that together encode a structured object -- a path in a graph, an entity-relation triple, or an ordering of objects. Such a large output space makes learning hard and requires vast amounts of labeled data. Different approaches leverage alternate sources of supervision. One approach -- entropy regularization -- posits that decision boundaries should lie in low-probability regions. It extracts supervision from unlabeled examples, but remains agnostic to the structure of the output space. Conversely, neuro-symbolic approaches exploit the knowledge that not every prediction corresponds to a valid structure in the output space. Yet, they do not further restrict the learned output distribution.This paper introduces a framework that unifies both approaches. We propose a loss, neuro-symbolic entropy regularization, that encourages the model to confidently predict a valid object. It is obtained by restricting entropy regularization to the distribution over only the valid structures. This loss can be computed efficiently when the output constraint is expressed as a tractable logic circuit. Moreover, it seamlessly integrates with other neuro-symbolic losses that eliminate invalid predictions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a series of semi-supervised and fully-supervised structured-prediction experiments, where it leads to models whose predictions are more accurate as well as more likely to be valid.},

We propose a consistent, non-parametric, scalable kernel test to operationalize the relational independence test for non-i.i.d. observational data under a set of structural assumptions. We empirically evaluate our proposed method on a variety of synthetic and semi-synthetic networks and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art kernel-based independence tests.},

    abstract = {Randomized smoothing is a recent technique that achieves state-of-art performance in training certifiably robust deep neural networks. While the smoothing family of distributions is often connected to the choice of the norm used for certification, the parameters of these distributions are always set as global hyper parameters independent from the input data on which a network is certified. In this work, we revisit Gaussian randomized smoothing and show that the variance of the Gaussian distribution can be optimized at each input so as to maximize the certification radius for the construction of the smooth classifier. Since the data dependent classifier does not directly enjoy sound certification with existing approaches, we propose a memory-enhanced data dependent smooth classifier that is certifiable by construction. This new approach is generic, parameter-free, and easy to implement. In fact, we show that our data dependent framework can be seamlessly incorporated into 3 randomized smoothing approaches, leading to consistent improved certified accuracy. When this framework is used in the training routine of these approaches followed by a data dependent certification, we achieve 9\% and 6\% improvement over the certified accuracy of the strongest baseline for a radius of 0.5 on CIFAR10 and ImageNet.},

Low-resolution large eddy simulation (LES) is a popular alternative, but it is unable to capture all of the scales of turbulent transport accurately. Reconstructing DNS from low-resolution LES is critical for large-scale simulation in many scientific and engineering disciplines, but it poses many challenges to existing super-resolution methods due to the complexity of turbulent flows and computational cost of generating frequent LES data. 
    We propose a physics-guided neural network for reconstructing frequent DNS from sparse LES data by enhancing its spatial resolution and temporal frequency. Our proposed method consists of a partial differential equation (PDE)-based recurrent unit for capturing underlying temporal processes and a physics-guided super-resolution model that incorporates additional physical constraints. 
    We demonstrate the effectiveness of both components in reconstructing the Taylor-Green Vortex using sparse LES data. Moreover, we show that the proposed recurrent unit can preserve the physical characteristics of turbulent flows by leveraging the physical relationships in the Navier-Stokes equation.},

Therefore, in this work we formulate, prove, and empirically test the conditions for an Empirical Bayes Estimator (EBE) to dominate the weighted mean aggregation.

    abstract = {We consider a population protocol version of the SIR model. In every round, an individual is chosen uniformly at random. If the individual is susceptible, then it becomes infected w.p. $\beta I_t/N$, where $I_t$ is the number of infections at time $t$ and $N$ is the total number of individuals. If the individual is infected, then it recovers w.p. $\gamma$, whereas, if the individual is already recovered, nothing happens.

We prove sharp bounds on the probability of the disease becoming pandemic vs extinguishing early (dying out quickly). The probability of extinguishing early, $\Pr{\mathcal{E}_{ext}}$, is typically neglected in prior work since most use (deterministic) differential equations.
Leveraging on this, using $\Pr{\mathcal{E}_{ext}}$, we proceed by bounding the expected size of the population that contracts the disease $\mathbf{E}\left[R_\infty\right]$. Prior work only calculated $\mathbf{E}\left[R_\infty~|~\overline{\mathcal{E}_{ext}}\right]$, or obtained non-closed form solutions.


We then study the two-country model also accounting for the role of $\Pr{\mathcal{E}_{ext}}$.
 We assume that both countries have different infection rates $\beta^{(i)}$, but share the same recovery rate $\gamma$. In this model, each round has two steps: First, an individual is chosen u.a.r. and travels w.p. $p_{travel}$ to the other country. Afterwards, the process continues as before with the respective infection rates.

Finally, using simulations, we characterise the influence of $p_{travel}$ on the total number of infections. Our simulations show that, depending on the $\beta^{(i)}$, increasing $p_{travel}$ can decrease or increase the expected total number of infections $\mathbf{E}\left[R_\infty\right]$.},

Here we focus on learning read-once disjunctive normal forms (DNFs) under the uniform distribution with a convex neural network and gradient methods. We first observe empirically that gradient methods converge to compact solutions with neurons that are aligned with the terms of the DNF. This is despite the fact that there are many zero training error networks that do not have this property. Thus, the learning process has a clear inductive bias towards such logical formulas. Following recent results which connect the inductive bias of gradient flow (GF) to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of minimum norm problems, we study these KKT points in our setting. We prove that zero training error solutions that memorize training points are not KKT points and therefore GF cannot converge to them. On the other hand, we prove that globally optimal KKT points correspond exactly to networks that are aligned with the DNF terms. These results suggest a strong connection between the inductive bias of GF and solutions that align with the DNF. We conclude with extensive experiments which verify our findings.},

AUTM offers a versatile and efficient way to the design of normalizing flows with explicit inverse and unrestricted function classes or parameters. Theoretically, we present a constructive proof that AUTM is universal: all monotonic normalizing flows can be viewed as limits of AUTM flows. We provide a concrete example to show how to approximate any given monotonic normalizing flow using AUTM flows with guaranteed convergence. The result implies that AUTM can be used to transform an existing flow into a new one equipped with explicit inverse and unrestricted parameters.

To our knowledge, this is a first and substantial improvement of the existing sample complexity for achieving individual fairness. Through experiments on three data sets, we show the proposed active AMF learner improves fairness on linear and non-linear models more efficiently than its passive counterpart as well as state-of-the-art active learners, while maintaining a comparable accuracy. To facilitate algorithm design and analysis, we also design a provably equivalent form of the approximate metric fairness based on uniform continuity instead of the existing almost Lipschitz continuity. },

    abstract = {End-to-end learning of dynamical systems with black-box models, such as neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), provides a flexible framework for learning dynamics from data without prescribing a mathematical model for the dynamics. Unfortunately, this flexibility comes at the cost of understanding the dynamical system, for which ODEs are used ubiquitously. Further, experimental data are collected under various conditions (inputs), such as treatments, or grouped in some way, such as part of sub-populations. Understanding the effects of these system inputs on system outputs is crucial to have any meaningful model of a dynamical system. To that end, we propose a structured latent ODE model that explicitly captures system input variations within its latent representation. Building on a static latent variable specification, our model learns (independent) stochastic factors of variation for each input to the system, thus separating the effects of the system inputs in the latent space. This approach provides actionable modeling through the controlled generation of time-series data for novel input combinations (or perturbations). Additionally, we propose a flexible approach for quantifying uncertainties, leveraging a quantile regression formulation. Results on challenging biological datasets show consistent improvements over competitive baselines in the controlled generation of observational data and inference of biologically meaningful system inputs.},

Two major challenges in this framework are privacy, since user data is often sensitive, and compression, since the user devices have low network bandwidth. Prior work has addressed these challenges separately by combining standard compression algorithms with known privacy mechanisms. In this work, we take a holistic look at the problem and design a family of privacy-aware compression mechanisms that work for any given communication budget. We first propose a mechanism for transmitting a single real number that has optimal variance under certain conditions. We then show how to extend it to metric differential privacy for location privacy use-cases, as well as vectors, for application to federated learning. Our experiments illustrate that our mechanism can lead to better utility vs. compression trade-offs for the same privacy loss in a number of settings.},

    Learning a parametric model of a data distribution is a well-known statistical problem that has seen renewed interest as it is brought to scale in deep learning. Framing the problem as a self-supervised task, where data samples are discriminated from noise samples, is at the core of state-of-the-art methods, beginning with Noise-Contrastive Estimation (NCE). Yet, such contrastive learning requires a good noise distribution, which is hard to specify; domain-specific heuristics are therefore widely used. While a comprehensive theory is missing, it is widely assumed that the optimal noise should in practice be made equal to the data, both in distribution and proportion. This setting underlies Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in particular. Here, we empirically and theoretically challenge this assumption on the optimal noise. We show that deviating from this assumption can actually lead to better statistical estimators, in terms of asymptotic variance. In particular, the optimal noise distribution is different from the data's and even from a different family.},

Each influencer has a maximum number of ad requests she can accommodate. We assign a fixed number of influencers to an advertiser when she enters the platform. The advertiser then matches with each of the assigned influencers with a probability, which can be thought of as a set of negotiations between the advertiser and the set of assigned influencers.

More importantly, unlike previous work, significant gains across a variety of benchmarks are achieved by combining StackMix with existing Mix augmentation, effectively mixing more than two images. E.g., by combining StackMix with CutMix, test error in the supervised setting is improved across a variety of settings over CutMix, including 0.8\% on ImageNet, 3\% on Tiny ImageNet, 2\% on CIFAR-100, 0.5\% on CIFAR-10, and 1.5\% on STL-10. Similar results are achieved with Mixup. We further show that gains hold for robustness to common input corruptions and perturbations at varying severities with a 0.7\% improvement on CIFAR-100-C, by combining StackMix with AugMix over AugMix. On its own, improvements with StackMix hold across different number of labeled samples on CIFAR-100, maintaining approximately a 2\% gap in test accuracy --down to using only 5\% of the whole dataset-- and is effective in the semi-supervised setting with a 2\% improvement with the standard benchmark Pi-model.

However, it is not clear how to best apply foundation models without labeled data. A potential approach is to fuse foundation models with weak supervision frameworks, which use weak label sources---pre-trained models, heuristics, crowd-workers---to construct pseudolabels. The challenge is building a combination that best exploits the signal available in both foundation models and weak sources. We propose LIGER, a combination that uses foundation model embeddings to improve two crucial elements of existing weak supervision techniques. First, we produce finer estimates of weak source quality by partitioning the embedding space and learning per-part source accuracies. Second, we improve source coverage by extending source votes in embedding space. Despite the black-box nature of foundation models, we prove results characterizing how our approach improves performance and show that lift scales with the smoothness of label distributions in embedding space. On six benchmark NLP and video tasks, LIGER outperforms vanilla weak supervision by 14.1 points, weakly-supervised kNN and adapters by 11.8 points, and kNN and adapters supervised by traditional hand labels by 7.2 points.},

Existing methods seek such features by measuring how greatly the feature attributes affect the degree of the {\it conditional average treatment effect} (CATE).

To resolve this weakness of existing methods, we propose a feature selection framework for discovering {\it distributional treatment effect modifiers}. We first formulate a feature importance measure that quantifies how strongly the feature attributes influence the discrepancy between potential outcome distributions. Then we derive its computationally efficient estimator and develop a feature selection algorithm that can control the type I error rate to the desired level. Experimental results show that our framework successfully discovers important features and outperforms the existing mean-based method.

We mitigate both issues by adding a novel regularization term to the existing losses. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that added regularization stabilizes training. Finally, we present a novel benchmark that evaluates MI-based losses on both the MI estimation power and its capability on the downstream tasks, closely following the pre-existing supervised and contrastive learning settings.

We focus on a multiclass classification setting and first show that, if experts make predictions on their own, the underlying causal mechanism generating their predictions needs to satisfy a desirable set invariant property. Further, we show that, for any causal mechanism satisfying this property, there exists an equivalent mechanism where the predictions by each expert are generated by independent sub-mechanisms governed by a common noise. This motivates the design of a set invariant Gumbel-Max structural causal model where the structure of the noise governing the sub-mechanisms underpinning the model depends on an intuitive notion of similarity between experts which can be estimated from data.

We also exploit the theoretical guarantees to optimize the weights assigned to individual previous tasks through regret minimization via online learning, which diminishes the impact of dissimilar tasks and hence further enhances the robustness. Empirical evaluations show that (a) RM-GP-UCB performs effectively and consistently across various applications, and (b) RM-GP-TS, despite being less robust than RM-GP-UCB both in theory and in practice, performs competitively in some scenarios with less dissimilar tasks and is more computationally efficient.

Our key algorithmic idea that enables achieving this improved complexity is based on the observation that the convergence in FL is hampered by two sources of high variance: (i) the global server aggregation step with multiple local updates, exacerbated by client heterogeneity, and (ii) the noise of the local client-level stochastic gradients. The first issue is particularly detrimental to FL algorithms that perform plain averaging at the server. By modeling the server aggregation step as a generalized gradient-type update, we propose a variance-reducing momentum-based global update at the server, which when applied in conjunction with variance-reduced local updates at the clients, enables \texttt{FedGLOMO} to enjoy an improved convergence rate.

precisely, the data are assumed to be generated by
a mixture of simple linear Hawkes processes. In
this new setting, the classes are discriminated by
various triggering kernels. A challenge is then to
build an efficient classification procedure. We de-
rive the optimal Bayes rule and provide a two-step
estimation procedure of the Bayes classifier. In the
first step, the weights of the mixture are estimated;
in the second step, an empirical risk minimization
procedure is performed to estimate the parameters

tency of the resulting procedure and derive rates of
convergence. Finally, the numerical properties of
the data-driven algorithm are illustrated through a
simulation study where the triggering kernels are
assumed to belong to the popular parametric expo-
nential family. It highlights the accuracy and the
robustness of the proposed algorithm. In particular,
even if the underlying kernels are misspecified, the
procedure exhibits good performance.},

We add the constraint that our algorithm is non-exploitable, in that the opponent lacks an incentive to use an algorithm against which we cannot achieve rewards exceeding some ``fair'' value.
Our solution is an expert algorithm (LAFF),
which searches within a set of sub-algorithms that are optimal for each opponent class,
and
punishes evidence of exploitation by switching to a
policy that enforces a fair solution.
With benchmarks that depend on the opponent class, we first show that LAFF has sublinear regret uniformly over 
these classes.
Second, we show that LAFF discourages exploitation, 
because exploitative opponents have linear regret. 
To our knowledge, this work is the first to provide guarantees for both regret and non-exploitability in multi-agent learning.},

    abstract = {One popular deep-learning approach for the task of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection is based on thresholding the values of per-class Gaussian likelihood of deep features. However, two issues arise with that approach: first, the distributions are often far from being Gaussian; second, many OOD data points 
fall within the effective support of the known classes' Gaussians. Thus, either way it is hard to find a good threshold. In contrast, our proposed solution for OOD detection is based on a new latent space where: 1) each known class is well captured by a nearly-isotropic Gaussian; 2) those Gaussians are far from each other and from the origin of the space (together, these properties effectively leave the area around the origin free for OOD data). Concretely, given a (possibly-trained) backbone deep net of choice, we use it to train a conditional variational model via a Kullback Leibler loss, a triplet loss, and a new distancing loss that pushes classes away from each other.  During inference, the class-dependent log-likelihood values of a deep feature ensemble of the test point are also weighted based on reconstruction errors, improving further the decision rule. Experiments on popular benchmarks show that our method yields state-of-the-art results, a feat achieved despite the fact that, unlike some competitors, we make no use of OOD data for training or hyperparameter tuning.

This work bridges this practicality gap by rendering the DP-means approach a viable, fast, and highly-scalable solution. First, we study the strengths and weaknesses of previous attempts to parallelize the DP-means algorithm. Next, we propose a new parallel algorithm, called PDC-DP-Means (Parallel Delayed Cluster DP-Means), based in part on delayed creation of clusters. Compared with DP-Means, PDC-DP-Means provides not only a major speedup but also performance gains. Finally, we propose two extensions of PDC-DP-Means.

The second extends PDC-DP-Means to  a Mini-Batch setting (with an optional support for an online mode),  allowing for another major speedup. We verify the utility of the proposed methods on multiple datasets. We also show that the proposed methods outperform other nonparametric methods (e.g., DBSCAN).

By construction, per iteration, ResIST communicates only a small portion of network parameters to each machine and never uses the full model during training. Thus, ResIST reduces the per-iteration communication, memory, and time requirements of ResNet training to only a fraction of the requirements of full-model training. In comparison to common protocols, like data-parallel training and data-parallel training with local SGD, ResIST yields a decrease in communication and compute requirements, while being competitive with respect to model performance.},

In this work, we propose a new structure learning algorithm, Explainable Structured Model Search (ESMS), that learns a templated graphical model and an explanation framework for its predictions. ESMS uses a novel search procedure to efficiently search the space of models and discover models that trade-off predictive accuracy and explainability. We introduce the notion of relational stability and prove that our proposed explanation framework is stable. Further, our proposed piecewise pseudolikelihood (PPLL) objective does not require re-optimizing the rule weights across models during each iteration of the search. In our empirical evaluation on three realworld datasets, we show that our proposed approach not only discovers models that are explainable, but also significantly outperforms existing state-out-the-art structure learning approaches.},

    Existing works considered either aleatory or epistemic risk individually, or as an additive combination.
    We prove that the additive formulation is a particular case of the composite risk when the epistemic risk measure is replaced with expectation.

The ensemble of K learners uses Follow The Regularised Leader (FTRL) to aggregate the return distributions and obtain the composite risk.
    We experimentally verify that SENTINEL-K estimates the return distribution better, and while used with composite risk estimates, demonstrates higher risk-sensitive performance than state-of-the-art risk-sensitive and distributional RL algorithms.},

   abstract = {In reinforcement learning, the graph Laplacian has proved to be a valuable tool in the task-agnostic setting, with applications ranging from skill discovery to reward shaping. Recently, learning the Laplacian representation has been framed as the optimization of a temporally-contrastive objective to overcome its computational limitations in large (or continuous) state spaces. However, this approach requires uniform access to all states in the state space, overlooking the exploration problem that emerges during the representation learning process. In this work, we propose an alternative method that is able to recover, in a non-uniform-prior setting, the expressiveness and the desired properties of the Laplacian representation. We do so by combining the representation learning with a skill-based covering policy, which provides a better training distribution to extend and refine the representation. We also show that a simple augmentation of the representation objective with the learned temporal abstractions improves dynamics-awareness and helps exploration. We find that our method succeeds as an alternative to the Laplacian in the non-uniform setting and scales to challenging continuous control environments. Finally, even if our method is not optimized for skill discovery, the learned skills can successfully solve difficult continuous navigation tasks with sparse rewards, where standard skill discovery approaches are no so effective.},

We learn the parameters of the pushforward by minimizing a meta-loss associated to the KRR objective. Since the resulting kernel does not admit an analytical form, we adopt a random feature sampling approach to approximate it. We call the resulting method Implicit Kernel Meta-Learning (IKML). We derive a meta-learning bound for IKML, which shows the role played by the number of tasks $T$, the task sample size $n$, and the number of random features $M$. In particular the bound implies that $M$ can be the chosen independently of $T$ and only mildly dependent on $n$.

Approaches have been developed that typically address the costs in one of these phases.

Furthermore it is possible to build ensembles of these models and apply hierarchical ensemble distillation approaches. Experiments on CIFAR-100 showed that S2D models outperformed standard models and Monte-Carlo dropout.

    After initial release of a machine learning algorithm, the model can be fine-tuned by retraining on subsequently gathered data, adding newly discovered features, or more. Each modification introduces a risk of deteriorating performance and must be validated on a test dataset. It may not always be practical to assemble a new dataset for testing each modification, especially when most modifications are minor or are implemented in rapid succession. Recent work has shown how one can repeatedly test modifications on the same dataset and protect against overfitting by (i) discretizing test results along a grid and (ii) applying a Bonferroni correction to adjust for the total number of modifications considered by an adaptive developer. However, the standard Bonferroni correction is overly conservative when most modifications are beneficial and/or highly correlated. This work investigates more powerful approaches using alpha-recycling and sequentially-rejective graphical procedures (SRGPs). We introduce two novel extensions that account for correlation between adaptively chosen algorithmic modifications: the first leverages the correlation between consecutive modifications using flexible fixed sequence tests, and the second leverages the correlation between the proposed modifications and those generated by a hypothetical prespecified model updating procedure. In empirical analyses, both SRGPs control the error rate of approving deleterious modifications and approve significantly more beneficial modifications than previous approaches.},

The well-known nearest neighbor estimator of TE potentially fails if temporal dependencies are noisy and long ranged, primarily because it estimates TE indirectly relying on the estimation of joint entropy terms in high dimensions, which is a hard problem in itself. Other estimators, such as those based on Copula entropy or conditional mutual information have similar limitations. Leveraging the successes of modern discriminative models that operate in high dimensional (noisy) feature spaces, we express TE as a difference of two conditional entropy terms, which we directly estimate from conditional likelihoods computed in-sample from any discriminator (timeseries forecaster) trained per maximum likelihood principle. To ensure that the in-sample log likelihood estimates are not overfit to the data, we propose a novel perturbation model based on locality sensitive hash (LSH) functions, which regularizes a discriminative model to have smooth functional outputs within local neighborhoods of the input space. Our estimator is consistent, and its variance reduces linearly in sample size.

The framework is particularly amenable to the class of sequential resource allocation problems since feasibility with respect to typical resource constraints cannot be enforced in a scalable manner. The NP framework provides an alternative that adds modest overhead during the online phase. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the NP framework on two continuous real-world tasks: (i) the portfolio optimization problem with liquidity constraints for financial planning, characterized by non-stationary state distributions; and (ii) the dynamic repositioning problem in bike sharing systems, that embodies the class of supply-demand matching problems.

This paper investigates three approaches to Bayesian inference: stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo, Bayes by Backpropagation, and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian. The inference is implemented over the weights of the deep neural networks that parameterize the likelihood of the Variational Autoencoder.

On ImageNet, our approach can reach 94% of success rate while reducing training computations from 11.6 to 2.4 exaflops, compared to an ensemble of independently trained DNNs. Our vanilla surrogate achieves 87.5% of the time higher transferability than three test-time techniques designed for this purpose. Our work demonstrates that the way to train a surrogate has been overlooked, although it is an important element of transfer-based attacks.

For this, we characterize the difference between the training data and the target population as a sample selection bias using a selection variable. Over an uncertainty set around this selection variable, we optimize the minimax value of a policy to achieve the best worst-case policy value on the target population. In order to solve the minimax problem, we derive an efficient algorithm based on a convex-concave procedure and prove convergence for parametrized spaces of policies such as logistic policies. We prove that, if the uncertainty set is well-specified, our policies generalize to the target population as they can not do worse than on the training data.

We consider the Savage's framework with a finite set of states and assume that preferences of the Decision Maker over acts are observable. The CEU model involves two parameters that must be tuned to the value system of the decision maker: a set function (capacity) modeling weights attached to events, of size exponential in the number of states, and a utility function defined on the space of outcomes.  Our aim is to learn a sparse representation of the CEU model from preference data.  We propose and test a preference learning approach based on a spline representation of utilities and the sparse learning of capacities to obtain CEU models achieving a good tradeoff between the aim of sparsity and the expressivity required by preference data.},

We show its application in eliciting quadratic violation-based group-fair metrics. Our strategy requires only relative preference feedback, is robust to noise, and achieves near-optimal query complexity.

This is costly. We reconsider old work (Laplace Bridge) to construct a Dirichlet approximation of this softmax output distribution, which yields an analytic map between Gaussian distributions in logit space and Dirichlet distributions (the conjugate prior to the Categorical distribution) in the output space. 
    Importantly, the vanilla Laplace Bridge comes with certain limitations. We analyze those and suggest a simple solution that compares favorably to other commonly used estimates of the softmax-Gaussian integral.
    We demonstrate that the resulting Dirichlet distribution has multiple advantages, in particular, more efficient computation of the uncertainty estimate and scaling to large datasets and networks like ImageNet and DenseNet. 
    We further demonstrate the usefulness of this Dirichlet approximation by using it to construct a lightweight uncertainty-aware output ranking for ImageNet. },

Existing deep generative models can typically capture either structure, but not both.  In this work, we introduce a novel deep generative model, called CIGMO, that can learn to represent category, shape, and view factors from image data.  The model is comprised of multiple modules of shape representations that are each specialized to a particular category and disentangled from view representation, and can be learned using a group-based weakly supervised learning method.  By empirical investigation, we show that our model can effectively discover categories of object shapes despite large view variation and quantitatively supersede various previous methods including the state-of-the-art invariant clustering algorithm.  Further, we show that our approach using category-specialization can enhance the learned shape representation to better perform down-stream tasks such as one-shot object identification as well as shape-view disentanglement.},

We hypothesize that pseudo-labeling on a vast array of unlabeled molecules can serve as gold-label proxies to expand the training labeled dataset significantly. The challenge in pseudo-labeling is to prevent the bad pseudo-labels from biasing the model. Motivated by the entropy minimization framework, we develop a simple and effective strategy Pseudo that can assign pseudo-labels, detect bad pseudo-labels through evidential uncertainty, and prevent them from biasing the model using adaptive weighting. Empirically, Pseudo improves quantum calculations accuracy in full data, low data, and out-of-distribution settings. },

Based on an experimental study, we conclude that theoretically well-justified measures also lead to better performance in practice. Besides, we corroborate the difficulty of the disaggregation problem, that is, of decomposing the amount of total uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a sound manner, thereby complementing theoretical findings with empirical evidence.},

Interestingly, the model allows for closed-form likelihood by employing the cumulative distribution function of the multivariate Gaussian distribution. In stark contrast to the continuous-valued case, we prove non-identifiability of the model with few observed variables; our empirical results imply identifiability when the number of observed variables is higher. We present a practical method for binary ICA that uses only pairwise marginals, which are faster to compute than the full multivariate likelihood. Experiments give insight into the requirements for the number of observed variables, segments, and latent sources that allow the model to be estimated.},

We consider the task of releasing elements of the metric space under metric differential privacy where utility is measured as the distance of the released element to the original element. Linear programming (LP) can be used to construct a mechanism that achieves the optimal utility for a particular mDP constraint. However, these LPs suffer from a polynomial explosion of variables and constraints that render them impractical for solving real-world problems. An important question is how to design rigorous mDP mechanisms that balance the utility- scalability tradeoff.
Our main contribution is a new method for reducing the LP size used to generate mDP mechanisms by constraining the search space such that certain input and output pairs have transition probabilities derived from the exponential mechanism. Our method produces mDP mechanisms whose LPs are smaller that all prior work in this area. We also provide a lower bound on the best possible mechanism utility. Our experiments on real-world metric spaces highlight the superior utility-scalability tradeoff of our mechanism.},

We instantiate this framework to use coin-betting algorithms and propose the \textbf{Coin Betting Politex (CBP)} algorithm. Assuming that the action-value functions are $\epsilon_{\text{\tiny{b}}}$-close to the span of the $d$-dimensional state-action features and no sampling errors, we prove that $T$ iterations of CBP result in an $O\left(\frac{1}{(1 - \gamma)^3 \sqrt{T}} + \frac{\epsilon_{\text{\tiny{b}}} \sqrt{d}}{(1 - \gamma)^2} \right)$ reward sub-optimality and an $O\left(\frac{1}{(1 - \gamma)^2 \sqrt{T}} + \frac{\epsilon_{\text{\tiny{b}}} \sqrt{d}}{1 - \gamma} \right)$ constraint violation.

We find that among these, only the former has received significant attention in the literature. To remedy this, we propose FedVARP, a novel variance reduction algorithm applied at the server that eliminates error due to partial client participation. To do so, the server simply maintains in memory the most recent update for each client and uses these as surrogate updates for the non-participating clients in every round. Further, to alleviate the memory requirement at the server, we propose a novel clustering-based variance reduction algorithm ClusterFedVARP. Unlike previously proposed methods, both FedVARP and ClusterFedVARP do not require additional computation at clients or communication of additional optimization parameters. Through extensive experiments, we show that FedVARP outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and ClusterFedVARP achieves performance comparable to FedVARP with much less memory requirements.},

  abstract = {Comparing structured data from possibly different metric-measure spaces is a fundamental task in machine learning, with applications in, e.g., graph classification. The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) discrepancy formulates a coupling between the structured data based on optimal transportation, tackling the incomparability between different structures by aligning the intra-relational geometries. Although efficient local solvers such as conditional gradient and Sinkhorn are available, the inherent non-convexity still prevents a tractable evaluation, and the existing lower bounds are not tight enough for practical use. To address this issue, we take inspirations from the connection with the quadratic assignment problem, and propose the orthogonal Gromov-Wasserstein (OGW) discrepancy as a surrogate of GW.  It admits an efficient and closed-form lower bound with O(n^3) complexity, and directly extends to the fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance, incorporating node features into the coupling.  Extensive experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets show the tightness of our lower bounds, and both OGW and its lower bounds efficiently deliver accurate predictions and satisfactory barycenters for graph sets.},

Our findings indicate that robust networks tend toward a universal set of representations, regardless of architecture, and that the robust training criterion is a strong prior constraint on the functions that can be learned by diverse modern architectures. We also find that the representations learned by a robust network of any architecture have an asymmetric overlap with non-robust networks of many architectures, indicating that the representations used by robust neural networks are highly entangled with the representations used by non-robust networks.},

For example, if collaborative robots were tasked with fighting wildfires, they may run out of suppressants and be temporarily unavailable to assist their peers. Because an agent's optimal action depends on the actions of others, each agent must not only predict the actions of its peers, but, before that, reason whether they are even present to perform an action.  Addressing openness thus requires agents to model each other’s presence, which can be enhanced through agents communicating about their presence in the environment.  At the same time, communicative acts can also incur costs (e.g., consuming limited bandwidth), and thus an agent must tradeoff the benefits of enhanced coordination with the costs of communication.  We present a new principled, decision-theoretic method in the context provided by the recent communicative interactive POMDP framework for planning in open agent settings that balances this tradeoff. Simulations of multiagent wildfire suppression problems demonstrate how communication can improve planning in open agent environments, as well as how agents tradeoff the benefits and costs of communication under different scenarios.},

Another well-known game-theoretic solution concept is the Banzhaf value. Although the Banzhaf value is closely related to the Shapley value, its properties w.r.t. feature attribution have not been understood equally well. This paper shows that, for tree ensemble models, the Banzhaf value offers some crucial advantages over the Shapley value while providing similar feature attributions. In particular, we first give an optimal O(TL + n) time algorithm for computing the Banzhaf value-based attribution of a tree ensemble model's output. Here, T is the number of trees, L is the maximum number of leaves in a tree, and n is the number of features. In comparison, the state-of-the-art Shapley value-based algorithm runs in O(TLD^2 + n) time, where D denotes the maximum depth of a tree in the ensemble. Next, we experimentally compare the Banzhaf and Shapley values for tree ensemble models. Both methods deliver essentially the same average importance scores for the studied datasets using two different tree ensemble models (the sklearn implementation of Decision Trees or xgboost implementation of Gradient Boosting Decision Trees). However, our results indicate that, on top of being computable faster, the Banzhaf is more numerically robust than the Shapley value.},

However, in many real-world settings, dynamics are estimated with significant uncertainty, e.g., via historical data, which can lead to bad outcomes if ignored. To address this, we develop an algorithm to compute minimax regret--robust policies for RMABs. Our approach uses a double oracle framework (oracles for \textit{agent} and \textit{nature}), which is often used for single-process robust planning but requires significant new techniques to accommodate the combinatorial nature of RMABs. Specifically, we design a deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, DDLPO, which tackles the combinatorial challenge by learning an auxiliary ``$\lambda$-network'' in tandem with policy networks per arm, greatly reducing sample complexity, with guarantees on convergence. DDLPO, of general interest, implements our reward-maximizing agent oracle. We then tackle the challenging regret-maximizing nature oracle, a non-stationary RL challenge, by formulating it as a multi-agent RL problem between a policy optimizer and adversarial nature. This formulation is of general interest---we solve it for RMABs by creating a multi-agent extension of DDLPO with a shared critic. We show our approaches work well in three experimental domains.},

Related to this, we identify the sigma-overfitting phenomenon when Gaussian augmentation overfits to a particular standard deviation used for training which has a significant detrimental effect on common corruption accuracy. We discuss how to alleviate this problem and then how to further enhance Lp adversarial training by introducing an efficient relaxation of adversarial training with learned perceptual image patch similarity as the distance metric. Through experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100, we show that our approach does not only improve the Lp adversarial training baseline but also has cumulative gains with data augmentation methods such as AugMix, DeepAugment, ANT, and SIN, leading to state-of-the-art performance on common corruptions.},

In this paper, we find that a simple approach of ensembling the standard and robust models, after calibrating on only ID data, outperforms prior state-of-the-art both ID and OOD. On ten natural distribution shift datasets, ID-calibrated ensembles get the best of both worlds: strong ID accuracy of the standard model and OOD accuracy of the robust model. We analyze this method in stylized settings, and identify two important conditions for ensembles to perform well on both ID and OOD: (1) standard and robust models should be calibrated (on ID data, because OOD data is unavailable), (2) OOD has no anticorrelated spurious features.},

    abstract = {Sampling and Variational Inference (VI) are two large families of methods for approximate inference that have complementary strengths. Sampling methods excel at approximating arbitrary probability distributions, but can be inefficient. VI methods are efficient, but may misrepresent the true distribution. Here, we develop a general framework where approximations are stochastic mixtures of simple component distributions. Both sampling and VI can be seen as special cases: in sampling, each mixture component is a delta-function and is chosen stochastically, while in standard VI a single component is chosen to minimize divergence. We derive a practical method that interpolates between sampling and VI by analytically solving an optimization problem over a mixing distribution. Intermediate inference methods then arise by varying a single parameter. Our method provably improves on sampling (reducing variance) and on VI (reducing bias+variance despite increasing variance). We demonstrate our method's bias/variance trade-off in practice on reference problems, and we compare outcomes to commonly used sampling and VI methods. This work takes a step towards a highly flexible yet simple family of inference methods that combines the complementary strengths of sampling and VI.},

We introduce a novel class of structured hierarchical games (SHGs) that formally capture such hierarchical strategic interactions. In an SHG, each player is a node in a tree, and strategic choices of players are sequenced from root to leaves, with root moving first, followed by its children, then followed by their children, and so on until the leaves. A player's utility in an SHG depends on its own decision, and on the choices of its parent and all the tree leaves. SHGs thus generalize simultaneous-move games, as well as Stackelberg games with many followers.  We leverage the structure of both the sequence of player moves as well as payoff dependence to develop a gradient-based back propagation-style algorithm, which we call Differential Backward Induction (DBI), for approximating equilibria of SHGs. We provide a sufficient condition for convergence of DBI and 
    demonstrate its efficacy in finding approximate equilibrium solutions to several SHG models of hierarchical policy-making problems.},

First, some noisy scenarios such as poor illumination conditions are likely to result in the uncertainty of pose estimation. Second, the output n-dimensional feature vector in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ cannot be well mapped to $SE(3)$ manifold. In this work, we propose a deep dual quaternion network that performs the absolute pose regression on $SE(3)$.  We first develop an antipodally symmetric probability distribution over the unit dual quaternion on $SE(3)$ to model uncertainties and then propose an intermediary differential representation space to replace the final output pose, which avoids the mapping problem from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $SE(3)$. In addition, we introduce a backpropagation method that considers the continuousness and differentiability of the proposed intermediary space. Extensive experiments on the camera re-localization task on the Cambridge Landmarks and 7-Scenes datasets demonstrate that our method greatly improves the accuracy of the pose as well as the robustness in dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity, compared to the state-of-the-art.},

two algorithms guarantee that every group of equivalent weights (caused by positively re-scaling) converge to the equivalent optima. Besides that, we
give convergence rates of the proposed algorithms on the PSI manifold. The results show that our methods accelerate training compared with the algorithms on the Euclidean weight space.

                approach for estimating the global ranking of a collection of
                items using pairwise comparisons. To ensure accurate ranking, it
                is essential to obtain precise estimates of the model parameters
                in the $\ell_{\infty}$-loss. The difficulty of this task depends
                crucially on the topology of the pairwise comparison graph over
                the given items. However, beyond very few well-studied cases,
                such as the complete and Erd{\"o}s-R{\'e}nyi comparison graphs,
                little is known about the performance of the maximum likelihood
                estimator (MLE) of the BTL model parameters in the
                $\ell_{\infty}$-loss under more general graph topologies. In

    abstract = {Autoregressive generative models can estimate complex continuous data distributions, like trajectory rollouts in an RL environment, image intensities, and audio. Most state-of-the-art models discretize continuous data into several bins and use categorical distributions over the bins to approximate the continuous data distribution. The advantage is that the categorical distribution can easily express multiple modes and are straightforward to optimize. However, such approximation cannot express sharp changes in density without using significantly more bins, which makes it parameter inefficient. We propose an efficient, expressive, multimodal parameterization called Adaptive Categorical Discretization (AdaCat). AdaCat discretizes each dimension of an autoregressive model adaptively, which allows the model to allocate density to fine intervals of interest, improving parameter efficiency. AdaCat generalizes both categoricals and quantile-based regression. AdaCat is a simple add-on to any discretization-based distribution estimator. In experiments, AdaCat improves density estimation for real-world tabular data, images, audio, and trajectories, and improves planning in model-based offline RL.},

This approach respects the conditional dependencies in the model and, through the Laplace approximation, treats the temporal states jointly, thereby avoiding their sequential learning.

To protect users' privacy, previous differential privacy (DP) definitions are not very suitable, and we propose a new DP notion that acts on the user cluster level.

We propose an algorithm to avoid this overfitting through a new per-state-neighborhood normalization constraint, and provide a theoretical justification of the proposed algorithm.

However, it is in general impossible to measure the reliability of an \textit{individual} prediction. In this work, we propose the local calibration error (LCE) to span the gap between average and individual reliability. For each individual prediction, the LCE measures the average reliability of a set of similar predictions, where similarity is quantified by a kernel function on a pretrained feature space and by a binning scheme over predicted model confidences. We show theoretically that the LCE can be estimated sample-efficiently from data, and empirically find that it reveals miscalibration modes that are more fine-grained than the ECE can detect. Our key result is a novel {\textbf{lo}cal \textbf{re}calibration} method \method{}, to improve confidence scores for individual predictions and decrease the LCE.

Specifically, with a $\phi$-mixing process of data, we show that online SGD with proper periodic data-subsampling achieves an improved sample complexity over the standard online SGD in the full spectrum of the data dependence level. Interestingly, even subsampling a subset of data samples can accelerate the convergence of online SGD over highly dependent data.

However, despite their promise, low precision operations have received little attention for Gaussian process (GP) training, largely because GPs require sophisticated linear algebra routines that are unstable in low precision. We study the different failure modes that can occur when training GPs in half-precision. To circumvent these failure modes, we propose a multi-faceted approach involving conjugate gradients with re-orthogonalization, mixed precision, compact kernels, and preconditioners. Our approach significantly improves the numerical stability and practical performance of conjugate gradients in low precision over a wide range of settings, and reduces the runtime of 1.8 million data points to 10 hours on a single GPU, without requiring any sparse approximations.},

    abstract = {Recent works in adversarial robustness have proposed defenses to improve the robustness of a single model against the union of multiple perturbation types. However, these methods still suffer significant trade-offs compared to the ones specifically trained to be robust against a single perturbation type. In this work, we introduce the problem of categorizing adversarial examples based on their perturbation types. We first theoretically show on a toy task that adversarial examples of different perturbation types constitute different distributions---making it possible to distinguish them. We support these arguments with experimental validation on multiple l_p attacks and common corruptions. Instead of training a single classifier, we propose PROTECTOR, a two-stage pipeline that first categorizes the perturbation type of the input, and then makes the final prediction using the classifier specifically trained against the predicted perturbation type. We theoretically show that at test time the adversary faces a natural trade-off between fooling the perturbation classifier and the succeeding classifier optimized with perturbation-specific adversarial training. This makes it challenging for an adversary to plant strong attacks against the whole pipeline. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that PROTECTOR outperforms prior adversarial training-based defenses by over 5% when tested against the union of l_1, l_2, l_inf attacks. Additionally, our method extends to a more diverse attack suite, also showing large robustness gains against multiple l_p, spatial and recolor attacks.},

First, we propose a simple regret minimization algorithm that takes as input a causal graph with observable and unobservable nodes and in $T$ exploration rounds achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{m(\mathcal{C})/T})$ expected simple regret. Here $m(\mathcal{C})$ is a parameter dependent on the input CBN $\mathcal{C}$ and could be much smaller than the number of arms. We also show that this is almost optimal for CBNs whose causal graphs have an $n$-ary tree structure. 
    Next, we propose a cumulative regret minimization algorithm that takes as input a causal graph with observable nodes and performs better than the optimal MAB algorithms that do not use causal side-information.

    abstract = {Importance sampling (IS) is often used to perform off-policy evaluation but it is prone to several issues---especially when the behavior policy is unknown and must be estimated from data. Significant differences between target and behavior policies can result in uncertain value estimates due to, for example, high variance. Standard practices such as inspecting IS weights may be insufficient to diagnose such problems and determine for which type of inputs the policies differ in suggested actions and resulting values. To address this, we propose estimating the behavior policy for IS using prototype learning. The learned prototypes provide a condensed summary of the input-action space, which allows for describing differences between policies and assessing the support for evaluating a certain target policy. In addition, we can describe a value estimate in terms of prototypes to understand which parts of the target policy have the most impact on the estimate. We find that this provides new insights in the examination of a learned policy for sepsis management. Moreover, we study the bias resulting from restricting models to use prototypes, how bias propagates to IS weights and estimated values and how this varies with history length.},

This approach is straightforward to implement and requires significantly less training time than prior methods, yet obtains competitive results on three established datasets.

    abstract = {Mean-Field Control (MFC) is a powerful tool to solve Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problems. Recent studies have shown that MFC can well-approximate MARL when the population size is large and the agents are exchangeable. Unfortunately, the presumption of exchangeability implies that all agents uniformly interact with one another which is not true in many practical scenarios. In this article, we relax the assumption of exchangeability and model the interaction between agents via an arbitrary doubly stochastic matrix. As a result, in our framework, the mean-field `seen' by different agents are different. We prove that, if the reward of each agent is an affine function of the mean-field seen by that agent, then one can approximate such a non-uniform MARL problem via its associated MFC problem within an error of $e=\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}[\sqrt{|\mathcal{X}|} + \sqrt{|\mathcal{U}|}])$ where $N$ is the population size and $|\mathcal{X}|$, $|\mathcal{U}|$ are the sizes of state and action spaces respectively. Finally, we develop a Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) algorithm that can provide a solution to the non-uniform MARL with an error $\mathcal{O}(\max\{e,\epsilon\})$ and a sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ for any $\epsilon >0$.},

As such, previous methods result in models that are monotonic only in a small volume of the input space. We thus propose an approach that uses mixtures of training instances and random points to populate the space and enforce the penalty in a much larger region. As a second set of contributions, we introduce regularization strategies that enforce other notions of monotonicity in different settings. In this case, we consider applications, such as image classification and generative modeling, where monotonicity is not a hard constraint but can help improve some aspects of the model. Namely, we show that inducing monotonicity can be beneficial in applications such as: (1) allowing for controllable data generation, (2) defining strategies to detect anomalous data, and (3) generating explanations for predictions. Our proposed approaches do not introduce relevant computational overhead while leading to efficient procedures that provide extra benefits over baseline models.},

We argue that this is a very strong restriction, and we propose a relaxation by introducing the notion of representation complexity for a predicted set. In combination with probabilistic classifiers, this leads to a challenging inference problem for which specific combinatorial optimization algorithms are needed. We propose three methods and evaluate them on benchmark datasets: a na\"ive approach that is based on matrix-vector multiplication, a reformulation as a knapsack problem with conflict graph, and a recursive tree search method. Experimental results demonstrate that the last method is computationally more efficient than the other two approaches, due to a hierarchical factorization of the conditional class distribution.},

Our framework further enables an automatic replacement of the reference simulator with the surrogate when undertaking amortized inference. The fidelity and speed of our surrogates allow for both faster stochastic simulation and accurate and substantially faster posterior inference. Using an illustrative yet non-trivial example we show our surrogates' ability to accurately model a probabilistic program with an unbounded number of random variables. We then proceed with an example that shows our surrogates are able to accurately model a complex structure like an unbounded stack in a program synthesis example. We further demonstrate how our surrogate modeling technique makes amortized inference in complex black-box simulators an order of magnitude faster.

An appropriate strategy for making interpretable causal conclusions is to reduce the dimension of treatment. If individual elements of a multidimensional treatment vector weakly affect the outcome, but the overall relationship between treatment and outcome is strong, careless approaches to dimension reduction may not preserve this relationship. Further, methods developed for regression problems do not directly transfer to causal inference due to confounding complications. In this paper, we use semiparametric inference theory for structural models to give a general approach to causal sufficient dimension reduction of a multidimensional treatment such that the cause-effect relationship between treatment and outcome is preserved.

We propose RAPID-PDE, an algorithm to expedite the learning of sparse and decomposable PDEs. Our RAPID-PDE first uses random projection to compress the high dimensional sparse updates and features into low dimensional representations and then use these compressed signals during learning. Crucially, such a conversion is only carried out once prior to learning and the entire learning process is conducted in the compressed space. Theoretically, we derive a constant factor approximation between the projected loss function and the original one with logarithmic number of projected dimensions.

To this end, we propose in this paper a novel cycle class-consistent model based on optimal transport (OT) and knowledge distillation. The model consists of two agents, a teacher and a student cooperatively working in a cycle process under the guidance of the distributional optimal transport and distillation manner. The OT distance is designed to bridge the gap between the distribution of the target data and a distribution over the source class-conditional distributions. The optimal probability matrix then provides pseudo labels to learn a teacher that achieves a good classification performance on the target domain. Knowledge distillation is performed in the next step in which the teacher distills and transfers its knowledge to the student. And finally, the student produces its prediction for the optimal transport step. This process forms a closed cycle in which the teacher and student networks are simultaneously trained to conduct transfer learning from the source to the target domain. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing methods, especially the class-aware and OT-based ones on benchmark datasets including Office-31, Office-Home, and ImageCLEF-DA.},

Based on the insight, we further point out two limitations of the prioritized ER method: 1) outdated priorities and 2) insufficient coverage of the sample space. To mitigate the limitations, we propose our model-based stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics sampling method. We show that our method does provide states distributed close to an ideal prioritized sampling distribution estimated by the brute-force method, which does not suffer from the two limitations.

In this paper, we leverage these tractability properties to solve the robust maximum likelihood parameter estimation task in TPMs under the assumption that a TPM structure and complete training data is provided as input. Specifically, we show that TPMs learned by optimizing the likelihood perform poorly when data is subject to adversarial attacks/noise/perturbations/corruption and we can address this issue by optimizing robust likelihood. To this end, we develop an efficient approach for constructing uncertainty sets that model data corruption in TPMs and derive an efficient gradient-based local search method for learning TPMs that are robust against these uncertainty sets. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach on a collection of benchmark datasets.},

    abstract = {Predictive uncertainties in classification tasks are often a consequence of model inadequacy or insufficient training data. In popular applications, such as image processing, we are often required to scrutinise these uncertainties by meaningfully attributing them to input features. This helps to improve interpretability assessments. However, there exist few effective frameworks for this purpose. Vanilla forms of popular methods for the provision of saliency masks, such as SHAP or integrated gradients, adapt poorly to target measures of uncertainty. Thus, state-of-the-art tools instead proceed by creating counterfactual or adversarial feature vectors, and assign attributions by direct comparison to original images. In this paper, we present a novel framework that combines path integrals, counterfactual explanations and generative models, in order to procure attributions that contain few observable artefacts or noise. We evidence that this outperforms existing alternatives through quantitative evaluations with popular benchmarking methods and data sets of varying complexity.},

We also develop graphical criteria under which identifiability holds with probability one if the edge coefficients are sampled randomly from a distribution that is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure and $Y$ is childless.  As an estimator, we propose spaceIV and prove that it consistently estimates the causal effect if the model is identifiable and evaluate its performance on simulated data.

Our models consist of two latent Gaussian processes accounting respectively for the conditional quantile (or expectile) and the scale parameter of an asymmetric likelihood functions. Furthermore, we propose two BO strategies based on max-value entropy search and Thompson sampling, that are tailored to such models and that can accommodate large batches of points. Contrary to existing BO approaches for risk-averse optimisation, our strategies can directly optimise for the quantile and expectile, without requiring replicating observations or assuming a parametric form for the noise. As illustrated in the experimental section, the proposed approach clearly outperforms the state of the art in the heteroscedastic, non-Gaussian case.},

However, in some cases, the two agents may have different reward functions without having conflicting objectives. This involves a stronger notion of regret than the one used in previous works. This class of games, called general-sum Markov Games is far to be well understood and studied. We show that the new regret minimization problem is significantly harder than in standard Markov Decision Processes and zero-sum Markov Games. To do this, we derive a lower bound on the expected regret of any “good” learning strategy which shows the constant dependencies with the number of deterministic policies, which is not present in zerosum Markov Games and Markov Decision Processes. Then we propose a novel optimistic algorithm that nearly matches the proposed lower bound.

Its prediction that sufficiently wide neural networks behave as kernel methods, or equivalently as random feature models arising from linearized networks, has been confirmed empirically for certain wide architectures. In this paper, we compare the performance of two common finite-width convolutional neural networks, LeNet and AlexNet, to their linearizations on common benchmark datasets like MNIST and modified versions of it, CIFAR-10 and an ImageNet subset. We demonstrate empirically that finite-width neural networks, generally, greatly outperform the finite-width linearization of these architectures. When increasing the problem difficulty of the classification task, we observe a larger gap which is in line with common intuition that finite-width neural networks perform feature learning which finite-width linearizations cannot. At the same time, finite-width linearizations improve dramatically with width, approaching the behavior of the wider standard networks which in turn perform slightly better than their standard width counterparts. Therefore, it appears that feature learning for non-wide standard networks is important but becomes less significant with increasing width. We furthermore identify cases where both standard and linearized networks match in performance, in agreement with NTK theory, and a case where a wide linearization outperforms its standard width counterpart.},

Under various conditions on LSEMs and the model parameters the prior work provides efficient algorithms to recover the parameters. However, these results are often about generic identifiability. In practice, generic identifiability is not sufficient and we need robust identifiability: small changes in the observational data should not affect the parameters by a huge amount. Robust identifiability has received far less attention and remains poorly understood.  Sankararaman et al. (2019) recently provided a set of sufficient conditions on parameters under which robust identifiability is feasible. However, a limitation of their work is that their results only apply to a small sub-class of LSEMs, called ``bow-free paths.'' In this work, we show that for any ``bow-free model'', in all but $\frac{1}{\poly(n)}$-measure of instances robust identifiability holds. Moreover, whenever an instance is robustly identifiable, the algorithm proposed in Foygel et al., (2012) can be used to recover the parameters in a robust fashion. In contrast, for generic identifiability Foygel et al., (2012) proved that with measure $1$, instances are generically identifiable. Thus, we show that robust identifiability is a strictly harder problem than generic identifiability. Finally, we validate our results on both simulated and real-world datasets.},

Our analysis of SymNet reveals that it performs no better than random on 1/4th of planning competition domains. The key reasons are its design choices: it misses important information during graph construction, leading to (1) poor generalizability, and (2) potential non-identifiability of different actions. In response, our solution, SymNet2.0, substantially augments SymNet's graph construction approach by introducing additional nodes and edges which allow a better transfer of important information about a domain. It also improves SymNet's action decoders with relevant information from objects to make different actions identifiable during scoring. Extensive experiments on twelve competition domains, where we use imitation learning over data generated from the PROST planner, demonstrate that SymNet2.0 performs vastly better than SymNet. Interestingly, even though SymNet2.0 is trained over data from PROST, it outperforms the planner on several test instances due to former's ability to scale to large instances in a zero-shot manner.},

In this paper, we revisit the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algorithm, which is widely cited as a score-based algorithm for learning the MEC of the underlying causal structure. We observe that in order to make the GES algorithm consistent in a nonparametric setting, it is not necessary to design a scoring metric that evaluates graphs. Instead, it suffices to plug in a consistent estimator of a measure of conditional dependence to guide the search. We therefore present a reframing of the GES algorithm, which is more flexible than the standard score-based version and readily lends itself to the nonparametric setting with a general measure of conditional dependence. In addition, we propose a neural conditional dependence (NCD) measure, which utilizes the expressive power of deep neural networks to characterize conditional independence in a nonparametric manner. We establish the optimality of the reframed GES algorithm under standard assumptions and the consistency of using our NCD estimator to decide conditional independence. Together these results justify the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in causal discovery, as well as the advantages of using our NCD measure over kernel-based measures.},

Among the most studied compression techniques is the class of unbiased compression operators with variance bounded by a multiple of the square norm of the vector we wish to compress. By design, this variance may remain high, and only diminishes if the input vector approaches zero. However, unless the model being trained is overparameterized, there is no a-priori reason for the vectors we wish to compress to approach zero during the iterations of classical methods such as distributed compressed {\sf SGD}, which has adverse effects on the convergence speed. Due to this issue, several more elaborate and seemingly very different algorithms have been proposed recently, with the goal of circumventing this issue. These methods are based on the idea of compressing the {\em difference} between the vector we would normally wish to compress and some auxiliary vector which changes throughout the iterative process. In this work we take a step back, and develop a unified framework for studying such methods, conceptually, and theoretically. Our framework incorporates methods compressing both gradients and models, using unbiased and biased compressors, and sheds light on the construction of the auxiliary vectors.

We introduce a novel statistical framework for learning a mixture of 
local normalizing flows as ``chart maps'' over the data manifold. 
Our framework augments the expressivity of recent approaches while 
preserving the signature property of normalizing flows, that they admit 
exact density evaluation. We learn a suitable atlas of charts for the data 
manifold via a vector quantized auto-encoder (VQ-AE) and the distributions 
over them using a conditional flow. We validate experimentally that our 
probabilistic framework enables existing approaches to better model data 
distributions over complex manifolds.},

Observatories employ Adaptive Optics (AO) systems in order to acquire high sensitivity diffraction limited images of the sky. The incumbent ``workhorse'' for control of AO systems employs a linear real-time controller in a closed loop, with sensing of state performed via a (Shack-Hartmann) wavefront sensor (WFS). The actuators of a deformable mirror (DM) are driven, with the action performed in each iteration having a continuous representation as an array of DC voltages. The typical control regime is practical and scalable, nonetheless, there remains a residual uncompensated turbulence that leads to optical aberrations limiting the class of scientific assets that can be acquired. We have developed and trained a translational GAN model that accurately estimates residual perturbations from WFS images. Model inference occurs in 0.34 milliseconds using off-the-shelf GPU hardware, and is applicable for use in AO control where the control loop might be running at 500Hz. We develop an AO control regime with a second controller stage actuating a second DM controlled in an open loop according to the estimated residual turbulence. Using the open-source COMPASS tool for simulation, we are able to significantly improve the performance using our new regime.},

However, as of now DNNs have limited ability to operate in an open world, where they are tasked to identify pixels belonging to unknown objects and eventually to learn novel classes, incrementally. Humans have the capability to say: ``I don't know what that is, but I've already seen something like that''. Therefore, it is desirable to perform such an incremental learning task in an unsupervised fashion. We introduce a method where unknown objects are clustered based on visual similarity. Those clusters are utilized to define new classes and serve as training data for unsupervised incremental learning. More precisely, the connected components of a predicted semantic segmentation are assessed by a segmentation quality estimate. Connected components with a low estimated prediction quality are candidates for a subsequent clustering. Additionally, the component-wise quality assessment allows for obtaining predicted segmentation masks for the image regions potentially containing unknown objects. The respective pixels of such masks are pseudo-labeled and afterwards used for re-training the DNN, i.e., without the use of ground truth generated by humans. In our experiments we demonstrate that, without access to ground truth and even with few data, a DNN's class space can be extended by a novel class, achieving considerable segmentation accuracy.},

This is concerning considering that, even under simplifying assumptions such as causal sufficiency, the statistical risk of a model can differ significantly from its causal risk.

Our goal is to find answers to the question: How does the efficacy of an autoregressive (VAR) model in predicting statistical associations compare with its ability to predict under interventions?
    To this end, we introduce the framework of causal learning theory for forecasting. Using this framework, we obtain a characterization of the difference between statistical and causal risks, which helps identify sources of divergence between them. Under causal sufficiency, the problem of causal generalization amounts to learning under covariate shifts albeit with additional structure (restriction to interventional distributions under the VAR model). This structure allows us to obtain uniform convergence bounds on causal generalizability for the class of VAR models.

This joint learning approach results in algorithms that are not scalable as graph sizes grow. This paper proposes an approach that does not necessitate learning the entire causal model and focuses on learning only the intervention targets. The key idea of this approach is leveraging the property that interventions impose sparse changes in the precision matrix of a linear model. The proposed framework consists of a sequence of precision difference estimation steps. Furthermore, the necessary knowledge to refine an observational Markov equivalence class (MEC) to an interventional MEC is inferred.

In this case, it is not ideal to treat all data points as equally distributed. Motivated by such observations, we introduce a probabilistic BMF model that recognizes the object- and feature-wise bias distribution respectively, called bias aware BMF (BABF).

    author = {Wu, Shuang and Wang, Chi-Hua and Li, Yuantong and Cheng, Guang},
    abstract = {We propose a new bootstrap-based online algorithm for stochastic linear bandit problems. The key idea is to adopt residual bootstrap exploration, in which the agent estimates the next step reward by re-sampling the residuals of mean reward estimate. Our algorithm, residual bootstrap exploration for stochastic linear bandit (\texttt{LinReBoot}), estimates the linear reward from its re-sampling distribution and pulls the arm with the highest reward estimate. In particular, we contribute a theoretical framework to demystify residual bootstrap-based exploration mechanisms in stochastic linear bandit problems. The key insight is that the strength of bootstrap exploration is based on collaborated optimism between the online-learned model and the re-sampling distribution of residuals. Such observation enables us to show that the proposed \texttt{LinReBoot} secure a high-probability $\tilde{O}(d \sqrt{n})$ sub-linear regret under mild conditions. Our experiments support the easy generalizability of the \texttt{ReBoot} principle in the various formulations of linear bandit problems and show the significant computational efficiency of \texttt{LinReBoot}. },

Subsequently, vector-based similarity representations are learned from multiple perspectives to model multi-level alignments comprehensively. The Relation Graph Reconstruction (SRGR) module is further developed to enhance cross-modal correspondence by constructing similarity relation graphs and adaptively reconstructing them.

Base on our observations, we define several desirable properties of singular value distributions and propose a novel transformation function for updating the singular values. We show that apart from alleviating token uniformity, the transformation function should preserve the local neighbourhood structure in the original embedding space. Our proposed singular value transformation function is applied to a range of transformer-based language models such as BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa and DistilBERT, and improved performance is observed in semantic textual similarity evaluation and a range of GLUE tasks.},

Standard model-free RL algorithms focus on single-view settings and unify the representation learning and policy learning into an end-to-end training process.

Based on this, we present Self-Supervised Representations (S2R) for multi-view reinforcement learning, a sample-efficient representation learning method for learning features from high-dimensional images. In S2R, we introduce a representation learning framework and define a novel multi-view auxiliary objective based on the multi-view image states and Conditional Entropy Bottleneck (CEB) principle. We integrate S2R with the deep RL agent to learn robust representations that preserve task-relevant information while discarding task-irrelevant information and find optimal policies that maximize the expected return.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTML can significantly promote the model robustness against various advanced adversarial attacks while keeping competitive classification accuracy on original samples. Besides, our method is efficient as it only needs to adjust the embedding and introduces very little overhead on the standard training.

This paper proposes a hybrid approach, CoSPA, to address these issues. 1) This paper proposes an alterable copy mechanism to alleviate over-correcting by jointly learning to copy a correct character from input sentence, or generate a character from BERT. No method has used copy mechanism in BERT for CSC. 2) The attention mechanism is further applied on the phonic and shape representation of each character at the output layer. 3) Shape representation is enhanced by mining character glyph with ResNet, and fused with stroke representation via an adaptive gating unit.

However, the theoretical analysis of L0-SSC is restricted to clean data that lie exactly in subspaces. Real data often suffer from noise and they may lie close to subspaces. In this paper, we show that an optimal solution to the optimization problem of noisy L0-SSC achieves subspace detection property (SDP), a key element with which data from different subspaces are separated, under deterministic and semi-random model. Our results provide theoretical guarantee on the correctness of noisy L0-SSC in terms of SDP on noisy data for the first time, which reveals the advantage of noisy L0-SSC in terms of much less restrictive condition on subspace affinity. In order to improve the efficiency of noisy L0-SSC, we propose Noisy-DR-L0-SSC which provably recovers the subspaces on dimensionality reduced data.

    abstract = {Many modern machine learning applications, such as multi-task learning, require finding optimal model parameters to trade-off multiple objective functions that may conflict with each other. The notion of the Pareto set allows us to focus on the set of (often infinite number of) models that cannot be strictly improved. But it does not provide an actionable procedure for picking one or a few special models to return to practical users. In this paper, we consider optimization in Pareto set (OPT-in-Pareto), the problem of finding Pareto models that optimize an extra reference criterion function within the Pareto set. This function can either encode a specific preference from the users, or represent a generic diversity measure for obtaining a set of diversified Pareto models that are representative of the whole Pareto set. Unfortunately, despite being a highly useful framework, efficient algorithms for OPT-in-Pareto have been largely missing, especially for large-scale, non-convex, and non-linear objectives in deep learning. A naive approach is to apply Riemannian manifold gradient descent on the Pareto set, which yields a high computational cost due to the need for eigen-calculation of Hessian matrices. We propose a first-order algorithm that approximately solves OPT-in-Pareto using only gradient information, with both high practical efficiency and theoretically guaranteed convergence property. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method works efficiently for a variety of challenging multi-task-related problems.},

    abstract = {Recent works on sparse neural network training have shown that a compelling trade-off between performance and efficiency can be achieved. Existing sparse training methods usually strive to find the best sparse subnetwork possible in one single run, without involving any expensive dense or pre-training steps. For instance, dynamic sparse training (DST), as one of the most prominent directions,  is capable of reaching a competitive performance of dense training by iteratively evolving the sparse topology during the course of training. In this paper, we argue that it is better to allocate the limited resources to create multiple low-loss sparse subnetworks and superpose them into a stronger one, instead of allocating all resources entirely to find an individual subnetwork. To achieve this, two desiderata are required: (1) efficiently producing many low-loss subnetworks, the so-called cheap tickets, within one training process limited to the standard training time used in dense training; (2) effectively superposing these cheap tickets into one stronger subnetwork without going over the constrained parameter budget. To corroborate our conjecture, we present a novel sparse training approach, termed \textbf{Sup-tickets}, which can satisfy the above two desiderata concurrently in a single sparse-to-sparse training process. Across various models on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, we show that Sup-tickets integrates seamlessly with the existing sparse training methods and demonstrates consistent performance improvement.},

To defend against such attacks, an effective and popular approach, known as adversarial training (AT), has been shown to mitigate the negative impact of adversarial attacks by virtue of a min-max robust training method. While effective, it remains unclear whether it can successfully be adapted to the distributed learning context. The power of distributed optimization over multiple machines enables us to scale up robust training over large models and datasets. Spurred by that, we propose distributed adversarial training (DAT), a large-batch adversarial training framework implemented over multiple machines. We show that DAT is general, which supports training over labeled and unlabeled data, multiple types of attack generation methods, and gradient compression operations favored for distributed optimization. Theoretically, we provide, under standard conditions in the optimization theory, the convergence rate of DAT to the first-order stationary points in general non-convex settings.

Next, we give novel and improved data-dependent bounds: we show stability upper bounds for a large class of convex regularized loss functions, with negligible  regularization parameters, and improve existing data-dependent bounds in the non-convex setting.

    abstract = {In recent years, the vulnerability of networks has attracted the attention of researchers. However, in these methods, the impact of video compression coding on the added adversarial perturbation, i.e., the robustness of the video adversarial example, is not considered. When an adversarial sample is just generated, its attack capability is the strongest. However, with multiple video encoding and video decoding in Internet transmission, the added adversarial disturbance will be continuously eliminated, eventually leading to the attack on the adversarial sample performance disappearing. We define this phenomenon as the decay of the lifetime of adversarial examples. We propose an adversarial attack method based on optimized integer space to resist this performance degradation. The robustness of anti-coding, the visual concealment, and the attack success rate are all considered during the attack process. In addition, we have also reduced the rounding loss caused by normalization in the deep neural network model process. The contributions of our methods are 1) We show the performance degradation caused by video compression coding on existing video adversarial attack methods, which seems an effective way for detecting of defending video adversarial examples. 2) A robust video adversarial attack method is proposed to resist video compression coding. The experiment shows that our method performs better on the robustness of anti-coding, visual concealment, and attack success rate.},

    author = {Zhou, Fangting and He, Kejun and Ni, Yang},
    abstract = {We consider the problem of causal discovery (structure learning) from heterogeneous observational data. Most existing methods assume homogeneous sampling scheme and causal mechanism, which may lead to misleading conclusions when violated. We propose a novel approach that exploits data heterogeneity to infer possibly cyclic causal structures from causally insufficient systems. The core idea is to model the direct causal effects as functions of exogenous covariates that help explain sampling and causal heterogeneity. We investigate the structure identifiability properties of the proposed model. Structure learning is carried out in a fully Bayesian fashion, which provides natural uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its utility through extensive simulations and two real-world applications.},

    title = {Convergence Analysis of Linear Coupling with Inexact Proximal Operator},
    author = {Zhou, Qiang and Jialin Pan, Sinno},
    abstract = {Linear coupling is recently proposed to accelerate first-order algorithms by linking gradient descent and mirror descent together, which is able to achieve the accelerated convergence rate for first-order algorithms. This work focuses on the convergence analysis of linear coupling for convex composite minimization when the proximal operator cannot be exactly computed. It is of particular interest to study the convergence of linear coupling because it not only achieves the accelerated convergence rate for first-order algorithm but also works for generic norms. We present convergence analysis of linear coupling by allowing the proximal operator to be computed up to a certain precision. Our analysis illustrates that the accelerated convergence rate of linear coupling with inexact proximal operator can be preserved if the error sequence of inexact proximal operator decreases in a sufficiently fast rate. More importantly, our analysis leads to better bounds than existing works on inexact proximal operator. Experiment results on several real-world datasets verify our theoretical results.},

    title = {Information design for multiple independent and self-interested defenders: Work less, pay off more},
    author = {Zhou, Chenghan and Spivey, Andrew and Xu, Haifeng and Hong Nguyen, Thanh},
    abstract = {This paper studies the problem of information design in a general security game setting in which multiple independent self-interested defenders attempt to provide protection simultaneously on the same set of important targets against an unknown attacker. A principal, who can be one of the defenders, has access to certain private information (i.e., attacker type) whereas other defenders do not. We investigate the  question of how that principal, with additional private information, can influence the decisions of the defenders by partially and strategically revealing her information. We focus on the algorithmic study of information design for private signaling in this game setting. In particular, we develop a polynomial-time ellipsoid algorithm to compute an optimal private signaling scheme. Our key finding is that the separation oracle in the ellipsoid approach can be carefully reduced to bipartite matching. Furthermore, we introduce a compact representation of any ex-ante persuasive signaling schemes by exploiting intrinsic security resource allocation structures, enabling us to compute an optimal scheme significantly faster. Our experiment results show that by strategically revealing private information, the principal can significantly enhance the protection effectiveness on the targets.},

    abstract = {We propose a kernel-based nonparametric estimator for the causal effect when the cause is corrupted by error. We do so by generalizing estimation in the instrumental variable setting. Despite significant work on regression with measurement error, additionally handling unobserved confounding in the continuous setting is non-trivial: we have seen little prior work. As a by-product of our investigation, we clarify a connection between mean embeddings and characteristic functions, and how learning one simultaneously allows one to learn the other. This opens the way for kernel method research to leverage existing results in characteristic function estimation. Finally, we empirically show that our proposed method, MEKIV, improves over baselines and is robust under changes in the strength of measurement error and to the type of error distributions.},
